          planet, which by influence from Goerrg Rukh Lloell (Anti-Rukh
          coalition), left the Rukh Aegz alliance. The entire population
          resides in a city built only over the last 185 years, by the
          design of the famous Vargr architect Voronol. Taknarkag was
          reputed in the Rukh Aegz for it brilliant architectural design.
          Even Humans have copied this city to an extent. Humans will
          find the Trading Post bar and nightclub inviting, when this is
          designed specially for humans in mind. More daring humans, or
          humans which have experience with Vargr clientele and behavior
          may use the Kornak Lounge. The navy base are now staffed by the
          local militia with a few jump capable ships.

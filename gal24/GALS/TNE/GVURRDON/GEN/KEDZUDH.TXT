Introduction

   Commonality of Kedzudh was first established in 1044 to an answer to
   the corsair threat. The main enemy at that time was Kforuzeng, that
   had been around for about 3 years.
   
   As Kforuzeng grew, Kedzudh got more followers. In about 1100 Kforuzeng
   changed tactic. Kforuzeng managed to get a treaty signed with Kedzudh.
   Kedzudh needed rest from raidings, and Kforuzeng needed a safe border
   to cross when the going got to tough.
   
   Kedzudh needed support to secure its borders. At first it may seem
   strange to outsiders that these two groups sign a treaty. The reason
   is that Kforuzeng had no raidings into Kedzudh between 1078 and 1100.
   Most pirates came either from the Imperium or from Tuglikki sector
   which Kforuzeng only had limited support from.
   
   After FFW the atmosphere between Kedzudh and Kforuzeng get sourer, due
   to the Imperium's attention to vargr corsairs. When Kforuzeng seemed
   unable to keep its groups together and unable to protect Kedzudh from
   raiders the treaty got nullified.
   
Recent History (1110+) 

   When Kforuzeng started to loose control over its subgroups, and the
   treaty with the band got nullified, a lot of worlds to the coreward
   left the communality. The reason to this was that they could stand up
   against the Kforuzeng now that it was weakened. They was neither
   threatened by the pirates from the Imperium.
   
   When the anti-Imperial Oekhsos tirades was released through
   entertainment devices, Kedzudh managed to get new members. The tirades
   did also help Kforuzeng from being disbanded.
   
   Kedzudh had from the beginning encouraged vargr that lived in the
   coreward systems of the Marches to revolt against the Imperium.
   However this proved difficult when the Imperium had too strong
   presence there.
   
   When the rebellion started in 1116, which threw Domain of Deneb into
   much confusion, Kedzudh started to lie plans. With the vargr invading
   in Corridor and the Aslans entering Spinward Marches in 1117 Kedzudh
   and Kforuzeng attacked the coreward border of the Spinward Marches.
   Kforuzeng and Kedzudh had by this time made a new treaty. The
   Glass-Bond as it is refereed to by Imperial vargr experts.
   
   The reason to that Kedzudh relinked with Kforuzeng is that Kforuzeng
   got the know-how. Kedzudh did have the vargrpower and funds, but
   lacked the skilled leaders. Which are needed to perform a military
   action against the Imperium. But not only the combined force of these
   two groups did secure the operation.
   
   Already in 1113 Kedzudh had established a undercover network within
   the Imperial borders. This is the main reason to that Kedzudh and
   Kforuzeng managed to get far as they did when they launched their
   attack. The vargr rich worlds coreward in the Marches proved to be
   excellent source to find anti-Imperial sentiments. All that was needed
   was to get this seed to grow.
   
Government 

   The government of Kedzudh is built up by representatives from the
   various governments in the different systems. The different worlds in
   Kedzudh conduct their own interior and exterior relations. However the
   Kedzudh government tries to coordinate the different systems. This is
   done so that all the systems may gain by the work done.
   
Military

   The worlds had initially their own military forces and administrated
   this as they saw fit. However to meet the corsair and the pirates from
   the Imperium they built a small space police/navy force. This force
   had two fleets of about 10 ships each. The largest ship was a 8000ton
   destroyer.
   
   Prior to the invasion of Aramis subsector in the Marches, Kedzudh
   built new ships. Some large as 15000ton. The attack on the Imperial
   Navy outpost at Triad (Gvurrdon 2436) was fruitful. The coalition
   managed to capture several crafts in dock.
   
   This gave a valuable boost to the military strength of the coalition.
   However the captured crafts was not used in the initial attack on the
   Imperium, when the coalition had to figure out how to operate them
   properly. Neither was it time to train crew and move the crafts into
   position. The Imperium would soon detect that an entire squadron was
   missing. With the help of the underground groups in the Imperium. The
   coalition managed to capture many systems before the Imperium managed
   to relocate their forces and build up a frontline. At present the
   position of the frontline have been stable after the Empire managed to
   take back a few systems. See the map in MTJ #1 for current frontline
   position.

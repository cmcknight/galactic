Introduction

   When Thirz empire was first founded in 1016 the Zhodani found it wise
   to have good relations to the new founded empire. Not that it feared
   it, but because the relationship would be of most importance when it
   came to the control of space in non Zhodani territories.
   
   Zhodani realized that they would have difficulties to control the
   corsair threat without outside help. Thirz Empire was found to be the
   best candidate. Thirz the First enjoyed high Charisma increases after
   he was proclaimed king. With Zhodani help he could expand his borders
   both spinward and trailing.
   
   Out of this cooperation there was trained a few selected sophonts to a
   new special force. A psionic force group (PSG) called Oruelaen.
   
   The close contact with Zhodani gave cheap and quite reliable psionic
   training to those who could afford it. The royal family is tested and
   trained for free.
   
Roles of the PSG

   The PSG is a small group of 250 sophonts. Officially they are known as
   the Royal Guard. This guard or group has several roles, both publicly
   and more secret roles. Only about 50 of the members are known by the
   public. And about 12 of those are truly famous. The others have not
   been recognised by name when they are doing jobs that demands
   discretion.
   
   The group is not a intelligence group, but have close contacts with
   the Thirz Empire Intelligence network. The main roles for this group
   is:
     * Bodyguard for the King. 12 Sophonts are designated as permanent
       bodyguard for the King, and at least four is present at all times
       when the king meet strangers.
     * Public relations. This is one of the smallest jobs the group does.
       It handles the communication with news agencies when the group is
       officially on a given mission. Giving relevant information of what
       is happening or have happened.
     * Investigation. If some problem arise that the king finds
       particulary interesting he may dispatch a few PSG members to the
       site to collect data. Sometimes this collides with the
       Intelligence network. At moments as this there will be cooperation
       between these two groups.
     * Undercover. Sending members on undercover missions is extremely
       rare. When it is done, there is almost always with the
       Intelligence Network.
     * War missions. Also a rare occurrence. Usually they are only sent
       out on observation missions, but certain special missions may be
       undertaken. This is then done with special forces that are trained
       to operate behind the enemy lines.
     * Observers. When certain actions are taken. For instance when
       diplomats are on a emissary mission agents may be present to
       observe and protect the diplomats.
   
Organization

   Due to the prestige and the small size of the group, there is
   difficult to enlist as a PSG member. Even more difficult is it to
   increase in rank. PSG members are seldom on dangerous missions without
   backup from skilled personnel (field agents, commandos).
   
   The only way to increase in rank is when a higher ranked officer is
   killed, retired or demoted and discharged. The king "owns" the group
   and may issue any order to it as he sees fit. The king holds the rank
   of General.
   
   Due to the high responsibility each individual has, the lowest rank is
   Sergeant. Thus making the lower rank members able to throw some weight
   around if need be. However they are not to take command if there is a
   lower ranked that are present that know the job in question in and
   out.
   
   Example: If a commando unit with one PSG officer present ends up in a
   situation that calls for special measures. The PSG officer may not
   take command even if the commando unit officer is of lower rank. If
   the PSG officer can prove that the commando officer is unable to do
   his job properly he may take command. In the latter case this will go
   to a hearing to investigate if the PSG officer acted within his
   authority.
   
Other Races Within the Force

   PSG accepts other races as members in their ranks if they have high
   PSI rating. Currently (1120) there is one Droyne Sport and two humans.
   There have been a few members from other minor races in the force, but
   that was in the early days.
   
Generating a PSG Member

   If you need a NPC or a PC wants to become a PSG member there is a few
   criteria that have to be fulfilled.
     * PSI rating of 8+.
     * Citizen of Thirz Empire.
     * Preferably one of these PSI abilities.
          + Telepathy.
          + Telekinesis.
          + Clairvoyancy.
          + Any useful special ability.
            
   Droynes are a special case. When they start with 1D in PSI rating. A
   new started Droyne can join if he has 5+ in PSI rating.
   
   When a person decided to join he or she is checked for how strong he
   or she is Psionically. If the strength is more than 8 he may then take
   tests. If the person manages to enlist he is trained in the abilities
   he got. The first year of the first term is used for training. Each
   ability start at level 1. At the end of each term roll on the table
   below to see how much the skill have increased the last four years.
   The skill level may not become higher than the PSI rating. Roll for
   each ability.
   
   For those who manage to enlist in this branch, increase charisma with
   one.
   
   Roll  PSI Skill Increase   |     Skill received:
    1        +2               |     Per term of service- 1
    2        +4               |     For each Commission- 1
    3        +4               |     For Promotion-       1
    4        +5               |     For Special Duty-    1
    5        +5               |     +1 if difficulty number is
    6        +7               |     beaten by 4+ on Comm and Special Dty.
   
   When the skill of a Droyne has reached upper limit of PSI skill, and
   the PSI rating is increased further the skill is automatically
   increased too.
   
   Enlist: 11+ on 2D. DM+1 if PSI rating 11. DM+1 if more than 1 ability.

Notes on Droynes

   To measure the level of Charisma of a Droyne: +1 Cha per term of
   service, +1 per every second leader skill. Initial Cha level is half
   the total amount.
   
   In this character generation procedure there is assumed that the
   Droyne is used to interact with Vargr so he start at full level.
   
   Differently from others the Droynes increase in PSI level as they grow
   older. A Droyne character may change any of the rolls on the personal
   development table for +1 in PSI level, once per term. The maximum PSI
   level possible is 15. Any increment in Cha from other rolls may be
   used to increase PSI rating with one.

History

   In 1067 Rukh took control over the Aegs worlds. At that time there was
   internal difficulties, and civil war. During the most heated
   confrontations Rukh was bidding his time. When the factions at last
   agreed on armistice, Rukh took control by overthrowing the different
   leaders. This increased his overall charisma, which was already high.
   
   He restored law and order in the realm. This maneuver and his high
   charisma won billions of followers that gathered under his flock. He
   secured a local powerbase of enormous proportions.
   
   However not everyone liked his maneuver to gain power. Many worlds
   rimward of Saell opposed to Rukh. They formed the Gnoerrg Rukh Loell.
   The anti-Rukh Coalition. This coalition has been a thorn in the side
   of Rukh since then.
   
   In 1094 The original leader Rukh died. But his successors continue his
   work through his dogma. After his death they lost a few worlds. The
   anti-Rukh coalition increased their effort to foil the works of Rukh
   in the hope that more worlds would pull out.
   
   However this was not the case. The Rukh government had too much
   control on local level to that the Anti-Rukh could have much effect.
   
   In 1112 Anti-Rukh started an operation to undermine the relations
   between Rukh and the Zhodani. Agents working for Anti-Rukh had managed
   to forge 6 Zhodani charge plates. The zhodani manages to get their
   hands on five of the plates. Which had been given to a small group of
   innocents. However the sixth plate did never turn up. One thing that
   was clear is that Anti-Rukh did not have the sixth plate.
   
   A vargr named Ronak was suspected of being the owner of the last
   plate. he never turned up. After a few years it became apparent that
   this plate had been reproduces, when different merchandise was paid
   with counterfeit charge plates. Anti-Rukh used this to disrupt trading
   and diplomatic relations between Rukh and Zhodani. The result was that
   several worlds between Rukh and Zhodani left Rukh.*
   
   To and answer to this the Rukh attacked Anti-Rukh physically. But the
   worlds that lie in between worked as a bufferzone. This lessened the
   effect somewhat. Anti-Rukh did not loose any territory, but a lot of
   damage to the system was a fact.
   
Government

   At first when Rukh seized control of the small Aegs federation
   billions flocked to hi because of his extreme charisma. However soon
   they also realized that he made his rule to something near a religion.
   anti-governmental work is prosecuted severely.
   
   The Rukh government are an elite council which are leaded by a
   dictator. The individual worlds have little local control when it
   comes to exterior policy. Internal policy is somewhat lesser
   controlled. But the Rukh doctrine must be followed. World governments
   are not represented in the Rukh government. They have to follow the
   whim of the Rukh government at any level. Worlds to have public
   election on local rulers, but the candidates have to be approved by
   the Rukh assembly.
   
   One of the first acts Rukh did when he had secured his powerbase, was
   to nationalize most of the bigger corporations. Especially Saell felt
   this. Seall is overpopulated, and the unemployment rate was extreme.
   The nationalization of the largest companies helped distribute the
   goods more evenly, but to the cost of galloping inflation.
   
Military

   All military forces are gathered under a central command. The forces
   are usually built from the world they are going to protect, but units
   often do change bases from one world to another. This circulation
   prevents worlds to have soldiers that will not shoot at locals in case
   of upheaval. Soldiers sympathize less with vargr they do not know.
   
   The military forces are financed by taxation of the individual
   sophont on the different worlds.
   
Internal (Un)rest

   To maintain control over the population to that degree the government
   have, they need an opposition. To Anti-Rukh's annoyance, they
   represent this opposition. Militarily Rukh could have crushed
   Anti-Rukh in matter of months. But by doing this they will loose the
   external enemy the government need gather the population against.
   
   Thus Anti-Rukh are actually allowed some success in their work. But
   then only on a limited scale. Time to time Anti-Rukh have had some
   very successful operations. More successful than the Rukh would have
   allowed if they could control the events completely.
   
   However there is internal difficulties as well. The knowledge about
   the universe outside Rukh is limited by the general population. This
   helps to disinform the populace. So generally the population believes
   that the Anti-Rukh is the big bad alien that will kill them if they
   get the chance.
   
   The coreward worlds of Rukh are more distant to Anti-Rukh, thus the
   treat from them is smaller. To make this treat larger, Rukh have
   allowed a small number of Anti-Rukh sediments infiltrate these worlds.
   Rukh do also carry out operations to scare the population to believe
   that there is more enemies present than there really is. Thus creating
   the illusion of that they have been penetrated and the enemy is
   constantly in their midst.
   
Uku

   Uku is the secret police in Rukh. It is divided into four branches.
   Each with their own responsibility. The branches are:
     * Counter espionage. This branch monitor and arrest foreign spies
       that operates within the borders of Rukh.
     * Espionage. This branch run cover operation outside Rukh borders.
       Mainly in Anti-Rukh worlds, and in the worlds between Rukh and
       Zhodani.
     * Population control. This branch, which is the largest, monitors
       internal dissidents. This branch operates closely with Counter
       Espionage branch.
     * Military intelligence. This branch gathers military information
       from other worlds and interstellar governments outside Rukh.
       
   Uku have operatives and offices on all planets within Rukh borders.
   They are known to be ruthless, and are feared by the general
   population.

   * The book Alien Realms covers this incident in the module No Credit
   Check. The module do not specify what the following to this incident
   will be. By comparing the map in AM3 with the map in V&V there is a
   few worlds that have left Rukh. I decided that this incident caused
   this.

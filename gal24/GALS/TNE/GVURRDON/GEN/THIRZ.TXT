History

   Thirz Empire was founded in 1016 by Aztangkuella Thir(1). He came from
   an old family of aristocrats. Thir was born 969 on Uthgvoe (Gvurrdon
   0512). When he came of age he started in politics and soon got popular
   for his high charisma.
   
   In 1012 the interstellar government that Uthgvoe belonged to went
   through political upheaval. A short civil war followed. Uthgvoe was
   spared from most of the war by declaring neutrality. When the
   combatants had expended most its fighting strength Thir took a
   gambling chance an appealed to both sides. Peace talks started in late
   1014, and armistice was declared. In 1015 agreement was met. And in
   1016 Thir was declared unanimous by the new council, King of the new
   established empire.
   
Government

   The King is the head of the government. Next under him is the council
   that are staffed by aristocrats that have been voted into their
   positions by the peerage. The peerage in consist of aristocrats that
   come from the different worlds in Thirz empire. A council member is
   voted into a position for 3 years. There is no limit on how long a
   member may be in the council.
   
   The different worlds are represented in the peerage, but only one
   aristocrat may represent the world in the council. Each world do also
   have a governor that represent the King on that world. This governor
   are usually from the world he or she is assigned to. In some cases the
   King may assign someone else as governor on that world. This is
   particulary done on worlds that have fallen for conquest. Most of the
   worlds Society of Equals lost to Thirz Empire have governors that is
   not citizen of that world.
   
   The king sits for life and his oldest son will take his seat if the
   king should die. He has vote in the council, but not a final decision.
   He have however delayed veto right. If a law or motion that he don't
   like are about to pass, he may lay down veto on the suggestion. The
   suggestion may not be taken up before 2 years have passed. The only
   member that can take it up before this time, is the king himself.
   
Military

   All military forces in the imperium is under the kings command without
   exception when he can declare that the nation is under threat by
   outsiders. In peacetime he can only command the Imperial navy and the
   Imperial troop forces. These forces are financed in several ways.
   
     * Hiring out forces to non-Thirz worlds that need help.
     * Taxes on the different worlds.
     * Piracy in hostile space
       
Relations to Zhodani 

   When Thir began to expand his imperium, Zhodani sought his cooperation
   when they could use him as a tool to prevent corsairs intruding on
   their worlds. They have helped Thirz Imperium with many things. A few
   of these things are:
   
     * Cheap psionic training for the royal family
     * Military aid. Giving Thirz better technology
     * Financial aid. Helping Thirz to establish trade agreement with
       Zhodani worlds.
     * Military advisors.
       
   Because of this many outside Vargr views Thirz Empire as a large
   client state of Zhodani.
   
Current King

   The current king Oekhueso Thir took over only 20 years old in 1109. He
   is the fourth king in succession. His first major test was the
   Equality war fought from 1111 to 1116. Thanks to his training from his
   father and his tutors he managed to keep the enemy at bay. Even for
   his inexperience he managed to keep the council together so that he
   could draw on their experience to solve matters. He did not make any
   rash decisions. His analytical mind helped him to take the correct
   decisions where it counted.
   
   After the war he rolled on a wave of high charismatic increase. In the
   latest years he have been working to get the worlds conquered from
   Society of Equals to accept his leadership. A few worlds have been
   swayed when their living standard have improved somewhat after the
   war.

Insignia 

   The insignia of Thirz Empire is the same used by the family of Thir in
   more than 1200 years. The circle under the shield holds the personal
   emblem of the family member. Thus the shield is present in all the
   family insignias, but the personal insignia within this circle changes
   from person to person. Thus when the old king died in 1109, all
   military starships and banners had to change the circle under the
   shield to the one now present. The old king had a red flower as his
   personal emblem.
   
    The swords got red pommel and the shield is colored blue on the
   dexter side (left), and green in the sinister side (right). The star
   is black with bright golden background. The lower part of the wreath
   looking thing is colored blue like the dexter side of the shield.
   While the two branches that circles the shield has the same green
   color on the lower part as the sinister side of the shield. The upper
   part got a lighter shade of green.

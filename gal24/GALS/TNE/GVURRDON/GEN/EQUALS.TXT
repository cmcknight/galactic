History

   Society of Equals (SoE) are one of the oldest interstellar governments
   in Gvurrdon. It dates back to about year 400. Lack of records make
   this date uncertain. Neither are there any records available that
   tells who founded this government.
   
   In the latest 300 years it have stood as a steady rock in the usually
   fluctuating structure of the Vargr society. But this is only on the
   surface. It has gone through a lot of changes since it was founded
   years back.
   
   From 930 to 1030 it quadrupled in size, most of it can be explained by
   sharp charismatic increase in the leaders, but equally true is it that
   much of the territory fell for conquest. From 1030 to about 1110 there
   was little change in territorial boundaries.
   
   SoE had for a long time border disputes with Thirz Empire. In 1109
   when the old king of Thirz Empire died, plans for conquest in Thirz
   was laid. The young Vargr that inherited the throne was viewed as
   low-charismatic by the leaders in SoE. They counted on that his
   inexperience and relatively low charisma would make it an easy
   victory.
   
   In 1111 they attacked over a broad frontline. At first they penetrated
   relatively deep into Thirz territory, but then it stopped. Thirz
   through their contact with the Zhodani managed to regroup and rebuilt
   what they had lost of military material. The throne heir did also have
   excellent leader capability which helped win the war for the Thirz
   Empire. When peace came in 1116 SoE had lost about 47% of their
   territory. Most of it to Thirz Empire. A few worlds rebelled and
   proclaimed themselves independent.
   
Government

   Society of Equals are ruled by an elite council. This council are
   staffed by the most charismatic persons in the empire. There is one
   representative from each world. They have one vote every million
   inhabitant for the world they come from. Those worlds that do not have
   one million inhabitants have to group together so that they can get
   one or more votes.
   
   A council member sits until there comes another Vargr with higher
   charisma. As a rule of thumb, the one with the lowest charisma in the
   council must retire or withdraw if there is someone that have higher
   charisma.
   
Equality, what equality?

   The gimmick with SoE is that before you can call yourself a worthy
   citizen of SoE, you have to be rated Equal. If a Vargr (or some other
   sophont) are going to have any of these careers he or she must be
   rated equal: Any military, Leader, Aristocrat and law enforcer.
   
   Even cubs from parents that have been rated equal must go through a
   test. Anyone that wants to may go through the test. It is usually
   taken at age of 16 to 18 years old.
   
   Not being rated equal do not spell disaster, but the choice of jobs
   are limited. For cubs to an aristocrat there will be a loss when the
   test fails. To be able to inherit the title and the estates the cub
   must be rated equal. If not, the cub will loose most of the
   inheritance.
   
   The law does protect the un-equal from abuse, but they must take what
   is second best. If a new world is to be colonized the Equals may
   choose first where they want to have their estates mines or what ever.
   
   
   Those who fail the test get their canines pulled. In this way there
   will be no question about their social status. Those who do not take
   this test usually becomes wanderers. When they are inside the borders
   of SoE they must wear a special head wear and belt. These are not
   treated like citizens, so they cannot get any work. However they are
   free to go where they please as everyone else.
   
   REFEREE: For characters that are born in Dzen Aeng Kho, they have to
   roll this task before they choose one of the following careers: Any
   military, Leader, Aristocrat and Law enforcer.
   
   Difficult,End,Int,[Hazardous]
   
   Referee: On a major mishap roll 1D+1 and subtract STR, DEX and END of
   the indicated amount. Example: The PC rolls a 4. He must subtract 2
   from STR and one from both DEX and END. For those who manage this task
   give a CHA+1 and a DM+1 on the enlistment roll on the chosen career.
   If the parents of the character is rated equal give a DM+1 on the
   above task. The parents are rated equal on a roll of 9+ on 2D.
   
Ranking

   An Equal ranks above an unequal vargr, but there are exceptions. For
   instance an Unequal vargr may own a starship and have a crew which is
   mixed with Equal and Unequal crew. This tend to be rare, but the
   situation exist. Because a vargr is unequal he or she are not
   prevented from starting their own business. Equal vargr that seeks
   employment with them are doing this on their own. And are not forced
   in any way to do so.
   
Slavery

   Only equals may have slaves. No citizen of SoE may become slaves,
   Equal or not. However there are rules about temporal slavery for
   unequals when they cannot pay for any damage they do on someone elses
   property.
   
   Slaves from outside are to be protected from hazards, but they can be
   put to dangerous and risky jobs. But only if they get neccesary safety
   equipment. A slave may also be sold further to others if the need
   arise.
   
   Slaves are slaves for life. If the owner decides he or she may free
   the slave from slavery. Usually slaves that have performed far beyond
   their required service are often set free. A slave that have been set
   free must get funds enough to survive a month. A free slave may
   applicate for citizenship and then also become an Equal if the test
   for that rating is passed.
   
Military

   The interstellar forces are financed by taxes of the different worlds.
   Council members have to contribute with their personal forces. How
   much they must contribute with depends on how wealthy and how large
   the population of his or hers world is. Low populated worlds usually
   only contribute with vargrpower that crew starships or are placed into
   infantry forces. More wealthy members contribute with starships.
   Larger starships like destroyers and cruisers are financed by the
   taxes.
   
The Insignia

   The insignia symbols the canines of an equal. The canines are the
   symbol of strength and power. Who came up with the symbol is unknown,
   but the symbol is not as old as the SoE is.
   
   The teeth are white while the background is red, just like in the
   mouth of a Vargr. On military vehicles and starships the teeth are
   usually tipped with red so it looks like they have been drawn blood.
   The honorary guard have teeth painted in silver. This symbols their
   steel hard discipline and strength.

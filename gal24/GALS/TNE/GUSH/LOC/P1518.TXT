Divkar (Imperial UWP D382566-6)
       (Human    UWP C382646-7)

Divkar was lucky. It had air and water, a moderate population and a limited
technology by IISS interdiction. The main city was often visited by tourists
and scientist surveying the Traypih population. Because of its low techlevel
virus had no impact to the economy. Even vice versa, with the recontact by
the "Last Sane" steady growing trade allowed them to build a class C tradeport.
As with the fall of the empire the IISS is also interdict gone, and refugees
from the barren worlds settled here. Each vilage is sending a group of
representatives to the anual municipal moot. The barnstorms and votes
are distributed over a radio network around the whole planet. The most
unusual thing about the representatives is certainly, that once they
are elected and send to the moot, they take their seat as long as they
have the vote of confidence of their vilage. If they lose it, they have
to leave the planet by law.

The world of Divkar (Rure 1518)  is the home of the amphibious Traypih.
A race  of  squid-like  sophonts  who   dwell  in  the  large,  shallow
lagoon-like seas of  Divkar, thriving in the warm  upper layers and the
abundant mud flats.  The Traypih are in the  process of developing full
intelligence and  are thus under  the intense and  watchful eye of  the
IISS.

The Traypih are approximately three meters long when fully mature with
a cluster of short tentacles at the  anterior end. One of the tentacles
is a highly developed sensor  cluster containing the Traypih equivalent
of  eyes, nose  and tongue.  There  are  a series  of pressure  sensors
present on  the flanks of the  Traypih which are capable  of picking up
the  slightest  changes  in  water  displacement  brought  about by the
slightest of movements.

Parallels  have been  drawn with  the Githiaskio  of Githiaski  (Dartho
0806, on the edge of the Lesser Rift).

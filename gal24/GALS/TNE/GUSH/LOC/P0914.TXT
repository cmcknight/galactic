Chulesh (Imperial  UWP C575666-6)
        (Human     UWP C5757B6-7)
        (Puppeteer UWP A575255-C) Red Zone

Chulesh was a imperial waste basked, or more precise a so called
captive colony ruled by a small police force with high tech
weapons from the techlevel B downport. Virus arrived late 1132
in form of a modern puppeteer strain called Eshnir. Unlike stupid
suiciders or doomslayers, Eshnir waited until he had infected anything 
to disclose.  He contacted a group of prisoners, attacked the police
force together with them and took control over the downport. Within
a year the port was upgraded to class A, and he produced 2 vessels
to expand to Munnarn. On Munnarn he couldn't get a stable foot as
the system all ready collapsed to TL:5 from 2 prior infections.

Chulesh has seen about 3 dozen TEDs in the last 70 years. Any of
them was a puppet, and was replaced by a new human puppet before
becoming independent from Eshnir. Eshnir is a tricky politician.
Most Chuleshi are not aware of him and think that Chulesh is leading
the resistance movement against the FDR.

In 1199 he managed to upgrade to Techlevel 12. Fortunately the FDR
had settled at this time, so he had no possibility to extend influence
by infection. As he officially supports the FDR protocol of trade
and is backed by his human population the FDR has no legal way to
disable him.

TRADE WARNING : He is based on dynamical linked systems at tech levels
A-C. Chulesh is declared a Red Zone. The Mercantile Guild advise to
boycott trade with his ships.

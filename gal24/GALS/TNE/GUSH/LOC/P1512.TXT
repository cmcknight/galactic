            (Human    UWP A4715C2-A)

The starport at 1512 was given up in 1127. To the end of the war Gagushilaag
was down to Tl:9 because lack of trade. This should be called a fortune, when
in 1131 a suicider arrived, it found nothing to do any real harm. Gagushilaag
atmosphere has an unusual high rate of carbon dioxide. Travellers are advised
to use their respirator masks to avoid suffocating effects all the times, even
if natives walk without, they are used to live here.

At 1147 the Gagushilaag received a Yacht yard, and is now back to Tl:A.

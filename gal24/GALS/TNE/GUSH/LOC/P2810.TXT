Mekar

Mekar has managed a controlled reduction in its tech level, and
maintened a high urban population. The world was united by a the
World Nation organisation in response to the threat of the
Collapse,  but in a very short tiime the World Nation turned
oppressive, utilising the world's remaining collection of high
tech weapons to maintain power.

Booce (Imperial UWP D899476-7)
      (Human    UWP X899476-7)

A backwater planet in imperial times with a dozen small villages without
a central government. The infect in 1131 had only minor effect on the
imported satellite communicators and the downport transponder check computer.
It was easily defended by the locals, without any losses in local population.
Each village is controlled by its own government, and the loss of a central
satellite network together with the isolation from the empire, had even
increased the balkanization effect.

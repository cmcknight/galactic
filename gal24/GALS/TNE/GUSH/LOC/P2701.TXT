Fubanan

Although having suffered an 8 level TL fall Fubanan has
maintained a good semblance of order.This has been made easy by
the ready food sources of a water world, and the low initial
population who could rapidly meet and exceed subsistence levels.
It is really only the small population which has prevented
further development.

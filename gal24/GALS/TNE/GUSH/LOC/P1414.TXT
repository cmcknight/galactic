Lanaas (Imperial UWP B9A9453-F)
       (1206     UWP X9A9000-0)

Home of the 935 CruRon/231st Penetration Fleet, Lanaas was hit by an unknown
kind of strain, probately an early suicider.  The complete population is
annihilated. Lanaas was visited by prospectors searching for Tl:F equipment
in the ruins of the former main city. But they soon realized that nothing
left from the storms of the fluid atmosphere.

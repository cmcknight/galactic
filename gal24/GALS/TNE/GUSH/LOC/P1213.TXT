Ushamdidishar (Imperial B8D06A9-C)

Ushamdidishar was home of the 6562 AssltRon / 231st Penetration Fleet.

As one of the most important naval base it had Tl:D sota and Tl:C plus
Tl:8 backup equipment. The warning message about virus from Usdiki was
seen and immediately followed before the egg was able to execute.

We can assume that virus was impressed from his new body, he went insane
thinking he's god within an hour. The following years saw fights between
the human population of the base and several different empires and
puppeteers. 

The takeover by the Last Sane was successful but costly on 283-1147
after 2 years of guerilla fights. The Munnarn assault troops, showed
their first glory in application of their silent infiltration tactic.
Those were General 'Muecke' worlds after he announced the win.

The reality : About 6 million humans lost their life 1131. Ushamdidishars
cities are floating disks in the gas giants. Only 72 thousand people
survived during the puppeteer wars. Additional 18 thousand Munnarni
lost their life in the takeover.

What did the Last Sane lost? Only 2 ships! The Munnarni troops were dropped
with life support for 4 weeks, thruster packs and equipment in a high orbit.
He didn't even risked one of those new Roaches, just a dozen container
liners doping containers full of warriors every week.

How sane was the disarmament movement of those "Last Sane" ?

A major Lancia centre, the world suffered badly during the
Rebellion. It is now a TED, led by a core of the old Provost.
The Lancia ideals have not been lost though, and the
dictatorship is relatively benign, the style being more suited
to the hard times. The New Provost does have its eye on
expansion and the first tentative steps towards system
re-settlement were taken in 1195.

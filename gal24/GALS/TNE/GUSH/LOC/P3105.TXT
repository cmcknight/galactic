Kukhun

Early in the Hard Times Kukhun adopted an isolationist attitude.
This does however apply only to non-Lancian's, so Kukhun could
form the basis of a Lancian state. Since 1135 Kukhun has been
run by a psionic cabal called the Kukhunen Collective. In the
dire times of the early 1130s a more dynamic government than the
existing "governors" bureaucracy  was required, and a psionic
art collective became a major motivating force and eventually
took power in a velvet revolution. The collective has attracted
criticism from many quarters, and the world is as divided as it
has been in 1000 years. The issue of re-expansion lies at the
heart of much of this division, and even the Collective seems
undecided on the best course of action.

Aintrin starport closed 1125, when the government decided to move the
production off world. The remaining million people left with the substandard
TL:8 equipment. While the government is still a stable feudal technocracy
based on Lancian traditions, the law level dropped several times. Trade with
the Last Sane enabled them to have a working downport 53. But the starports
low law level makes the consideration of declaring Aintrin amber necessary.

Several affairs including slavery, dealing with geneered material, dealing
with infected computers, drugs, and mass destruction weapons forced a boycott
at 1173. Any ship from Aintrin is considered infected and will be searched
by a quarantine team.

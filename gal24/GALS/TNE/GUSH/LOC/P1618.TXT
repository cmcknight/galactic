Gabradio had the luck that their primary infect was a modern Puppeteer
called Ishnahin, who decided that the meat was for value, at least
those who served him. Minor revolts in 1134 and 1136 killed about 80%
and 70% of the population.

When contacted by the Last Sane in 1141 he was restrained with a parent type.
The internal war was expensive, but not as expensive in terms of life as the
two revolts. Gabradio has now a stable participating democracy, and should
be counted to the backbone of the FDR.

About 300.000 humans and 200.000 awaken inhabit Gabradios city. A set of
pressure domes most of them abandoned, and salvaged long times ago.
The natural flora is limited to algae and sulphate bacteria because of the
trace pressure. So some of the former domes are now used for hydroponic.
The Hydroponic project is perhaps the only good thing to say about Ishnahin,
as it saved the life of "his" population. Gabradios industry is far from
being sustainable and depends mainly on Imaparlu. Gabradios former main
export robots is now impossible to sell, as selling robots counts as slavery.
So they are now trying in a variety of minor technical novelties, none
showed a major success so long. Even the starport, official high standard
with class C support for dynamic and class A support for holographic vessels,
is not frequented as expected. The local government had recently launched
a subsidiary program, with the main constrain that ships have to take the
Imaparlu-Gabradio-Abir route 4 times a year.

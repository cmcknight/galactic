Pucuro

Originally a hot bed of inter-state conflict the Collapse gave
Velova the opportunity to gain the upper hand, since it had the
least dependence on imported arms. The Velovian government took
planetary control in 1133, and Pucuro now has all the hallmarks
of a traditional Lancian world.

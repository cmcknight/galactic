The water bonding agent left over from the Pacification Campaign
meant that this world used to have a red zone classification.
Its small population has survived against high odds, but has
only been able to do so at the expense of their "humanity". When
it became evident that outside contact had been lost and that
the stillsuits and isolation seals of the underground habitats
could not be maintained the inhabitants made use of a genetic
metamorpher which had previously only been used to save
sentients whose stillsuits had failed. Whilst the change has
allowed the population to survive unprotected on the surface it
has radically changed both their appearance and their higher
brain functions and they now resemble a primitive and barely
human new minor race.

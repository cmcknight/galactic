Aakmi

A massive rurification campaign and a naturally fertile
environment allowed Aakmi to maintain a good standard of living
through the collapse, even if it is at a reduced tech level.
Again a benign TED has provided the strength of leadership, the
technological edge here having more to do with agrochemical,
harvesting, and processing technology than guns. The high law
level is aimed more at protection rather than oppression.

Sahee

Again a world which Lancian ideals have helped survive. Sahee is
noteworthy because of the development of its aquaculture. It has
a sizeable Scanian Aquan population, and the lack of external
hi-tech resources has forced terrestrial Saheeans to leave the
underwater cities, so allowing the Aquans population to expand
and gain in power.

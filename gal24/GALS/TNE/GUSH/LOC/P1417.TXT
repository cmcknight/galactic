Guzrin (Imperial UWP C836275-7)
       (1206     UWP X836000-0)

Guzrin's life support system was based on the Tl:E equipment of the class C
starport. Local Tl:7 production of aromatics was traded for high tech
equipment. In '32 a suicider infection disabled the starport facilities and 
pressure drop killed the 1000 people living there.

Abir (Imperial UWP B445668-8)
     (Human    UWP C445618-8)

Abir's economy is based on a local plant growing in the equatorial zone. The
dust of the plant, will reduce human life span by several years if inhaled
without a filter respirator mask, but if probately refined its the base of
SuSAG and Shishmadarshag Anagathics. SuSAG has recontacted the FDR in 1152
after the CABAL project was delivered to the Regency. Abir's downport is now
in corporate ownership of SuSAG, who undertook a major investment to bring
Abir's technology back to Tl:8.

SuSAG has bought 8 3000dt ships from AI Morai for the so called Island trade.
It should mentioned that this trade would be considered illegal in the Regency,
so only a few SuSAG representatives know about the FDR jump ports in the
Islands. While SuSAG refines the raw dust to Tl:F Anagathics-A, a second plant
at Platon is producing both the A and the cheaper B type. The B type is sold
to TEDs and other unwelcome government types around Rure, to avoid that they
will ever extend beyond their system. Smuggle within the Island brought this
version in the regency, where its considered a major problem.

Originally an Amber zone because of its anarchic law level, the
world became a dictatorship during the rebellion and has since
been taken over by R'kish, a cult leader who maintains power
though a psionic securitat formed out of the pre-collapse
oligarchy. R'kish is thought to have come to power around 1150,
and is now aged about 80.

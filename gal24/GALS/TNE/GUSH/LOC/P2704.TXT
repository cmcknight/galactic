Kyla

Decimated by a black war strike the remaining 103 sentients are
all ex-Navy personnel and are based on a remote island. The
Puulim Down atoll was devastated in a combined meson/nuclear
strike.

Referee: Kyla appears to have suffered out of all proportion for
the size of its Navy presence. The explanation is in the
existance of the KHG Navy Research facility, which was engaged
on Autonomous Software Program ( ASP ) research. This research
bore remarkable similiarity to the Virus. It is not certain that
KHG was destroyed in the strike.

          (Human    UWP X7A8575-5)

In Imperial times Lendaarii was an isolated Lancian settled world.
Sustaining the exotic environment with their Tl:5 equipment in small
dome villages. Virus had no effect to this culture, the tradeport was
closed years before the end of the war. Traders who visit Lendaarii
have to announce their cargo and wait for a radio message. If a city
is interested in trading they'll send a message and a radio beam for
the flight path. Its most likely to have trade allow if you carry a
variety of minor lots from Booce. The inhabitants are not interested
in any equipment of Tl8+ or Tl4-, but agricultural products are likely
to have a market as local production is limited to hydroponic farms.
The main export nitrogen compounds is likely to find a market within
Tl7-8 weapon production. The cargo should be handled with extreme care
as its explosive and corrosive. Traders should prepare their ship BEFORE
they jump to Lendaarii, as cargo containers are not sold from local
cities.

Munnarn (Imperial UWP A410553-F)
        (Human    UWP C410441-8)

Munnarn was the administrative  capital of the Rure subsector between
421 and 760. During rebellion Munnarn was the naval base for the 8184th
CruRon. Munnarn also had a long trade tradition of hosting the K&R line.

Because of its military importance in the rebellion Munnarn was still
TL:F when virus arrived at the first days of 1132 in form of a suicider
infecting the holographic linked systems of the naval base and starport.
In the following chaos about 93% of naval and civil personal died, until
the TL:A backup equipment was deployed and functionally. A Doomslayer
like second infection of this TL:A equipment one year later killed 52%
of the remaining people. A second downgrade, this time to TL:5 secured
the life of the remaining 26000 humans. After 7 years of fight, they
managed to kill the Doomslayer and recovered well to over 30000 humans. 

Diplomatic exchange between the Last Sane and elected Munnarni officers
in the early 40th enabled several of their squadrons to move to other
systems.  Military tradition is still most important in their society
and Munnarni are building the main asset of human ground troops the FDR
has. Their main value is their ability to cope with extreme situation
by using low tech improvisations.

While they received a tradeport in 72, no attempt is made to upgrade
their bunker world to TL:A to avoid giving Eshnir a target for his
expansion. Its rather thought to howl the remaining people to other
worlds of the FDR, or to deploy them as ship troopers for the CruRons.

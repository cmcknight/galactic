   Bruyere system was initially overlooked when the IISS made its first
   foray into Deneb Sector. And for good reason. The system is weak in
   natural resources and thus a poor candidate for development.
   
   From space, it's parched gray countenance does little to entice
   travellers to touch down on its surface. The planet's very thin
   atmosphere and liquid oceans are tainted by sulphur compounds that
   were released by eons ago by now-dormant volcanoes. Nearly all of the
   planet's water is concentrated into a single large ocean in the
   southern hemisphere.
   
   However, because the system possesses two gas giants it eventually
   attracted traders and freighters making the run between Liran and
   Minocoy. Scouts from the exploration branch set up rudimentary
   starport facilities at the system mainworld and an outer system world
   now known as Carthage. The IISS released more detailed survey
   information and opened the system to institutional study.
   
   Scientists from the Deneb and Usani eventually came to the planet (by
   this time unaffectionately named "872-444" by the IISS) to research
   its atmospheric taints.
   
   Dr. Ibsen Bruyere of the University of Usani first set foot on the
   planet's surface in 574. He and his research team spent six months on
   the barren world. During that time, they discovered the planet's vast
   network of natural catacombs. More amazing to Bruyere and his team of
   scientists was that the catacombs were inhabited by sentient beings!
   
   Several thousand Chirpers were discovered living in dispersed hovels
   hundreds of meters beneath the planet's surface. Though Chirpers had
   already been discovered on other worlds spinward of the Great Rift, it
   was an amazing find considering the planet's inhospitable environment.
   The scientists discovered that beneath the world's surface, higher
   atmospheric pressure and oxygen content made the environment
   survivable by the Chirpers.
   
   The system mainworld was named after the scientist who made this
   wonderful discovery. Since Dr. Bruyere's discovery, research teams
   from neighboring systems have visited the planet frequently primarily
   to study its subterranean native inhabitants.
   
   In recent times, archaeological teams have hypothesized that discovery
   of a new Ancients site is imminent on the world. They believe the
   catacombs are the remnants of some form of Ancient residential
   construction that the Chirpers inhabited during the intervening
   millenia.
   
   While the research teams continue to visit the world at a consistent
   rate, the scout service and RQS have also established a steady
   presence in the system. Because of the system's location between
   several strategic worlds, it makes a fine refueling and calibration
   point for scout and quarantine ships. The scouts on Bruyere also serve
   as law enforcement and "park rangers," protecting the native
   population of the planet.
   
   The RISS has recently given visitation permits to several Droyne
   Kroyloss' that intend to caste willing members of the Chirper
   population, thus indoctrinating them into Droyne culture. The
   suspicious Bruyerian Chirpers were at first cold to the idea, but
   racial recognition and curiosity about the koynisin ritual has begun
   to bring them out of their subterranean homes.

   A detailed background check is mandatory for employment on HRD.
   Because of the ubiquitousness of corporate espionage, hiring decisions
   are made very carefully. A GSbaG spy manages to steal LSP's prototype
   plan for a new jump drive. An Instellarms agent steals and patents
   Tactical Solutions' latest fusion rifle design before it hits the
   market. These are nightmare scenarios for HRD corporations. Corporate
   research facilities on HRD maintain the most stringent security
   available in the Regency. Though the world isn't interdicted, most
   corporate facilities effectively are. It isn't unusual for a
   corporation to employ armed security to protect their research
   facilities or mercenary units to guard top-secret prototypes enroute
   to manufacturing centers elsewhere in the Regency. DNA scanners are
   standard equipment at all entrances of most corporate facilities.

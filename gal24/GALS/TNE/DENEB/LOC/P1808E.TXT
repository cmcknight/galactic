
Festival
-------- 

   The first thing everyone does after arrival is look up at the immense
   hexagonal grid over them. Throughout most of the year, you'll only see
   a crystal clear, cloudless sky, faintly outlined with hundreds of
   hexagons. In the nighttime, the outlines glow faintly red: but that is
   all.
   
   But, if you arrived during the two-week Blazing Lights Festival, you'd
   see some fantastic pattern of lights and graphics in the sky,
   surpassing anything you may have seen in a VR tube. These Festivals
   have become more and more ornate since the Collapse, now including
   sounds and wind patterns specifically created for the artist,
   generated by the weather control system (imagine immense, organ-like
   sounds emanating from the roof and the winds: absolutely
   overwhelming).
   
   Of course, tickets for Antra tends to skyrocket as the Festival nears:
   not offically, of course, but the cost in bribes and favours can get
   very severe. Regardless of the offically fixed passenger prices
   (rumour has it that, even in the Wilds, they haven't changed a bit!),
   you only see the best and the wealthiest arrive on Antra in time for
   the Festival.
   
   Festival serves not only as the premiere social event of the
   subsector, but as one of five or six events of sector-wide reputation,
   and thus a location where Things Happen and media attention is
   guaranteed. Archduke Norris, for example, formally announced the
   engagement of his daughter on Antra.

   
  Introduction
  
   HRD is the primary brain trust of Deneb Sector. For centuries, the
   free-spending research facilities and progressively structured
   corporate environment of the planet have attracted some of the
   greatest minds of the Regency. HRD's path to fame was a difficult one,
   however. The system has weathered centuries of controversy and
   scandal, but has amazingly maintained a reputation as a premier
   private research facility.


The Future
----------

   Vincennes' future is uncertain. The components to achieve the most
   impressive technological power in Imperial and Regency history are
   present, but many detractors and obstacles stand in her way. The
   coming decades will be crucial to Vincennes' continued development
   both as a society and as a symbol of human innovative prowess. Most
   believe Vincennes can overcome these obstacles, but at best the
   planet's destiny remains shadowed in doubt.

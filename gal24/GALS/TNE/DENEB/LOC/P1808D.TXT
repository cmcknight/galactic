
Arriving on Antra
-----------------

   All people, articles and cargo are completely checked out by local
   antiVirus teams on the Highport, taking another day. (This includes
   medical examinations: no people with ANY artifical inorganic
   enhansements are permitted insystem. If caught in this stage of the
   game, they will be killed.) Another quickie 'make sure' check is made
   before leaving the elevator, and a final antiViral team awaits to
   greet the players just as they step off the 30 minute journey on the
   massive elevator, for another full check of everyone and everything.
   
     An entire RICE paper can be written on security procedures within
     the Regency, from the ultra-lax standards in the Seven Sisters to
     the short-and-vicious procedures of Trin, from the short and
     effective procedures of Vincennes to long, bureaucratic and
     paranoaic restrictions for Antra.


The Worldroof
------------- 

   As you finally approach Antra (at 1G, as per regulations), bathed
   under the dull red light of its star, you start to notice that it
   seems to be largely encased by glass. And when you arrive at the
   Highport - attached to Antra by a 50 km elevator - the vast Worldroof
   of Antra is revealed in all its glory. It covering over 80% of Antra,
   composed by a mosaic of hexagonal "glass" cells suspended in the air
   by 1,774 2km high 'tower groups'. Each 'tower group' is composed of
   seven towers: six towers supports the roof, generates power (via both
   capturing a small percent of the star's radiated energy and the
   200-300 km winds), and provides the best weather control in the
   Regency (or for that matter, in the preCollapse Imperium).
   
   The seventh tower is either an industrial or residential centre.
   Industrial centres were built with 5,000 inhabitants, residential
   centres - basically tower cities, in a style familiar on high-tech
   worlds - hold up to 500,000 people.
   
   No ship ever lands on Antra: the high-atmosphere winds are both fast
   and fickle, continually shifting to equalize the tempertature between
   the dark and light sides of Antra. Also, it's a security measure by
   the Antrans to again insure that Virus doesn't get in. Thus, all
   transport is via the Highport elevator.
   
     REFEREE: Why doesn't the atmosphere flow out of the 20% of the world
     not covered by the Worldroof? Ask the British Interplanetary
     Society: they're the ones who came up with this crazy idea! The
     'high-winds' part is a natural consequence of equalizing the
     temperatures, and moderating the nighttime low to the extent that
     the Antran want to: it should be doable given TL-14 tech.

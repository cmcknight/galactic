
Preface
-------   

   With all the hubbub about "imminent TL-17" Vincennes, I thought I'd
   pop this description in of the Vincennes in _my_ campaign. I've tried
   to remain as true as possible to the original write-up of the system
   that was presented in an old MegaTraveller Journal. I've created a
   pretty detailed set of additional background material since Vincennes
   is the focal system of my campaign. If anyone's interested in any of
   it, let me know.

   NOTE: The following RICE paper draws heavily upon the information
   presented in the Vincennes World Guide featured in MegaTraveller
   Journal #3. I would like to thank and acknowledge author Charles P.
   Kalina for his outstanding and descriptive article. This RICE paper
   is intended to build upon the information provided in the article
   and reestablish Vincennes in The New Era.

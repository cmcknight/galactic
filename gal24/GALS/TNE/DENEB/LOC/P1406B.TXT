
Astrographic Notes
------------------   

   Borlund is in orbit 1 around the primary star Crotiv. That half-dead
   star, Idanoll, is in orbit 5. Borlund does have a trivial satellite
   barely worthy of being called a moon (Symot: YS00000-0), about 115,200
   km from Borlund.
   
   Because of the placement of Idanoll, there is a real, black Night for
   only half the year. For other half of the year, there is this dim red
   glow instead, brighter than Earth's moon, but nowhere near Sol, or
   Crotiv. The shadows and other light-effects of these two star can be
   quite pretty.


Indispensible Tools
-------------------

   Borlundlander society is able to function thanks to a number of tools
   that they have seized on. Almost all managers, supervisors and other
   important personnel carry small computers (AI or Expert Systems),
   either wrist sized or 'tricorder' sized. These well-written programs
   provide much needed support and guidance in operating equipment,
   complex calculations, etc.
   
   Also, Borlund is probably the only world where robots are still in
   common use (although biogeneered monkeys and other 'organic robots'
   are slowly replacing them). True, almost all of these robots are at TL
   9, and thus expensive and slow. Still, without them, much of
   Borlundland society would be simply impossible.

   NOTE: due to the Worldroof - built as a major scientific experiment,
   and an implicit example of Imperial power to the Vargr, by order of
   Emperess Porfiria in 271, and finally completed in 883 - and extensive
   weather control (possibly the best in the Galaxy):
     * atmos should be changed to 1.000: thus, the air is breathable
     * TNE Weather changed to +8 (almost always crystal-clear weather,
       sometimes overcast)
     * daily temperature range = -10 noon, -20 midnight (Lowering the
       base temp to 19 degrees, but decreasing the severity of the
       nighttime from -78 to -20)
   
   Antra, its worldroof one of the Seven Wonders of the Imperium, is a
   must for any tourist of Deneb Sector. Despite the long, tedious and
   invading antiViral procedures, Antra still is a busy port of call, for
   its artworks and tourism sites, its vast radioactive mines - the
   largest in 25 parsecs - and its political connections. Still, caution
   is called for when among the xenophobic Antrans, and the beautiful
   towers that support the famed Worldroof rest on some nasty
   foundations...

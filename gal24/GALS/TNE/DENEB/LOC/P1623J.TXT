
  Strategic Value
  
   HRD is an extremely important system to the Regency and therefore
   requires special attention. The Regency Navy maintains a considerable
   portion of the 258th Fleet in the system, mostly in point defense of
   the system mainworld itself. HRD's unique history and governmental
   structure have fostered a climate in which intellectual freedom can
   flourish. Though the world of HRD itself is essentially a hostile
   airless rock, the society contained within is home to some of the
   greatest minds of the age. When Regency governments look for
   innovation, critical evaluation or conventional wisdom, they look to
   HRD.

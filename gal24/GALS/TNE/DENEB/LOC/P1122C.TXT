   Vincennes is the technological jewel of the Regency. The planet is the
   Regency's singlemost advanced producer of commercial technology, known
   for its unique environmental characteristics and reclusive society.
   Many detractors of Vincenzi success cite the system's inability to
   achieve universal TL-17 technology as indicative of the system's
   imminent decline. The growing interference of bureaucracies and the
   aristocracy in Vincenzi entrepreneurial interests threatens to derail
   all that the Vincenzi have built. The spectre of crime and corruption
   has begun to taint the planet's prospects as well. The upcoming age
   will not be easy for the Vincenzi, but if their hallowed
   entrepreneurial spirit prevails, Vincennes will continue to shine as a
   nexus of technological and societal wonder.

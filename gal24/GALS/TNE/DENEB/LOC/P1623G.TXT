   
  Jumpspace Institute
  
   The Jumpspace Institute, which maintains a research facility on HRD,
   is actively working to break the Jump-6 Barrier. While nearly all of
   the Institute's findings are classified and secured by Regency Naval
   Intelligence (RNI), it is known to the general public that HRD's
   Jumpspace Institute is pro-Jump^2 (or Jump Squared). Jump Squared
   advocates believe that the most probable method of breaking the Jump-6
   Barrier is to find a way to perform a jump while already in jump
   space.
   
   Chief opponents of the Jump Squared faction are the Misjumpers.
   Misjumpers believe that in order to break the Jump-6 Barrier,
   scientists must find a way to harness the chaotic effects of misjumps.
   One of the main proponents of the Misjumper faction are the Jumpspace
   Institute scientists at Research Station Zeta on Depot Beta (Zeng:
   Deneb/1432). Neither side has developed conclusive results, but the
   debate rages on.

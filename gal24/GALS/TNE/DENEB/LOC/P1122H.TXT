
Military & Law Enforcement
--------------------------

   Before the Collapse, Vincennes maintained their modest military and
   law enforcement requirements through The Special Branch, a relatively
   small police organization and considerable network of contractors. The
   ranks of The Special Branch have swelled to over 20 million permanent
   employees in recent years in order to combat the increasing presence
   of organized crime and the illegal activities of The Pack, the Vargr
   crime syndicate. The Special Branch continues to employ millions of
   contract employees in its law enforcement endeavors as well.
   
   Traditionally, Vincennes maintained no standing army, but with the
   return of the Humbolts, a new emphasis on military strength has been
   established. Under the auspices of the Humbolts the Vincenzi 1192nd
   Air Cavalry Division was formed to act in the defense of Vincennes in
   the event of an attack. The 1192nd officially reports to the Vice
   Marshall of the Regency Army, but the unit maintains an obvious
   pro-Humbolt stance. Scores of mercenary groups are employed to
   supplement military operations on Vincennes as well.
   
   Though no formal naval base exists in Vincennes System, the Regency
   Navy maintains a large presence at Defense, Paven and Stopover, three
   of the outer-system worlds. Defense operates a considerable System
   Defense Boat and small Destroyer fleet. Paven, the primary
   agricultural producer of the system is heavily guarded by a regiment
   of crack Regency Marines. Paven suffered a horrendous decline in
   production during a Rebellion-era famine thought to have been caused
   by planted biological agents. The marine garrison on Paven is intended
   to prevent another such occurrence. Stopover contains a refueling
   depot for Regency Naval ships.

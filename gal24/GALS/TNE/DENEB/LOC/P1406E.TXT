
Xenophobia
----------

   While Borlundlanders are xenophobes, they're not very aggressive about
   it. They prefer to avoid strangers when possible, and many refuse to
   talk to them. Violence might occur if the strangers are perceived as
   threats, with unpredictable results.

     REFEREE: Because many Borlundlanders are incapable of complex
     thought doesn't mean no one can outwit foreigners: punish travellers
     who act in a consistently stupid fashion. Some Borlundlanders can
     think quite well, thank you: and even the dumb ones will eventually
     learn how to hit back, if given time...

    Altiplano is another partially habitable world. Its atmospheric pressure
at sea level is too great for humans to breathe, but it becomes tolerable at
2000 meters and higher, allowing humans to inhabit the world's mountain 
ranges. Noricum, due to its odd combination of low gravity and thick 
atmosphere, has an amazingly rich and abundant ecology of aerial lifeforms.

of 4.68 billion, a decline of approximately 77 percent from its
Pre-Collapse population. Its highest population is 2.38 billion, at
Chernozem, and its highest tech level is 9 at Hamilcar, Chernozem,
Hephaistos and Greenpernt.

Subsector Notes
---------------
	The Gemini subsector is named for the bright stars of the Castor
system (which contains an unusual grouping of 3 binary pairs) and the
Pollux system (a 'K' class giant), which from Earth appear as "twin" star
systems, moving together through the evening sky. The asteroid belts in
these systems are quite different. The Pollux belt is little more than
gravel, making commercial exploitation unprofitable; the Castor belts, on
the other hand, are rich in metals, ices, and simple organics. Before the
Collapse, the Castor system supported a population over five billion.

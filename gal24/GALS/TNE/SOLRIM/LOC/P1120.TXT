Hsuishlesh is a Vegan world which is a trading partner of both the Dingir
League and the independent world of Cuchulain. Currently no starport
facilities exist planet-side, but a salvaged 25,000 ton battletender is
currently being "leased" to Hsuishlesh by the Dingir government (terms:
1Cr per year). The battletender is acting as an orbital facility for a
half dozen small starships (these were recently purchased outright at much
less of a discount by Hsuishlesh from Dingir) until legitimate starport
facilities can be constructed. Vegan culture here is quite strong, and in
contrast to Muan Gwi, so is the desire to intervene on "fallen" Vegan
worlds so that pre-Collapse Vegan culture can be reintroduced. Hsuishlesh
agents have intervened on several worlds in the subsector already, but
their missions are currently limited to espionage and gun running
activities, due to a lack of resources.

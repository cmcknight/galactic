	The nearby world of Menelaus claims the Alpha Ophiuchi system as part of
its territory, and has stationed a system defense boat squadron there to 
keep away outsiders (with varying degrees of success). Menelaus has
periodically exploited the treasure-trove of abandoned and wrecked vessels 
now present in the system, but their lack of large cargo vessels and limited
tech level (9) mean that so far they have only been able to salvage a few
easily recoverable vessels and procure enough spare parts to keep their 
fleet of some 36 ships (all less than 1,000 displacement tons) operational.

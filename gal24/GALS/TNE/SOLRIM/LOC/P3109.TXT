    Champa is the site of a still functional scout base, one of the few
remaining in the Solomani Rim. The base is entirely controlled and operated
by sentient robots, who maintain the facility (and the class 'B' starport) as
a way station for Vampire fleets as they make their way to and from Cymbeline
in the Arcturus subsector. Many Champa's human inhabitants bitterly resent the
presence of the Vampire garrison and their use of the planet's starport
facilities, and have maintained a spirited guerrilla campaign against the
occupiers for the last 35 years. Though they have met with only limited
success (and lost many guerrillas in the process), they continue to resist in
hopes of one day forcing the garrison out.

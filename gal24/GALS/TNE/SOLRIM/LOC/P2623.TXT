Hathor was the site of a bloody campaign in which the human population fought
long and valiantly against Vampire/Virus occupation. Finally stripped of the
last of its working space vessels, and with little in the way of a
ground-based defense capability, they surrendered. Today the residents of the
world are ruled by a Vampire fleet installed TED. Though his rule has been a
relatively benevolent one, the citizenry still yearn for independence.
Popular among the population is the story of a semi-mythical hero from Terra
who will one day appear and overthrow the occupation forces.

The outer system of Hathor is a staging area for Vampire ships as they
attempt to travel to Cymbeline.  At any one point, dozens of vessels can be
found in orbit of Hathor's gas giants.  Each of the gas giants is controlled
by a separate Vampire fleet, and skirmishes between them are frequent.  A few
enterprising Vampire ships (unaligned with any faction) have even set up a
sort of "protection racket" in an effort to take advantage of Vampire
pilgrimage.  For the cost of certain spare parts, they will guarantee the
safety of Vampire ship pilgrims as they attempt to refuel.  Double crosses
are frequent, and many pilgrims find that their "escorts" abandon them in
the face of a superior Vampire fleet, or attack them when they are vulnerable
in the upper reaches of a gas giant atmosphere.

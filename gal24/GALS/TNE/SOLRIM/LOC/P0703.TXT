	A roving pirate band recently set up operations at Kropotkin,
attracted by the renewed commercial activity in this region (and the fact
that they were kicked out of Magyar Sector by a stronger group of pirates).
No raids have been conducted yet on shipping out of Iddamakur or Darrukesh,
but reconnaissance missions are currently underway.

	Scipio is a self-interdicted colony of Solomani anti-technologists, who
have banned all technology except that known on Terra before space flight, and
consider it a mistake for true men ever to have left Earth. Finding no means of
isolating themselves from the Universe on Terra, they were forced to choose a
less inviting world. Scipio, because of this negative view of technology, was
ironically saved from the effects of the Collapse. Today, visitors to this
world will find the descendants of the original colonists to be a thrifty,
independent lot, who still shun higher technology and seem to delight in
telling visitors how right they were about space travel.

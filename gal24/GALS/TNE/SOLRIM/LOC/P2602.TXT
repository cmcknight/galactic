    Gashurzid was able to maintain a tech level far higher than most other
worlds in the Wilds. This is because around 50 years ago, the local
inhabitants made a defense treaty with a large Vampire fleet that had been
sporadically raiding the system. In exchange for the use of Gashurzid's
starport facilities (which have actually been upgraded since then, thanks to
supplies provided by the Vampire fleet), the fleet has guaranteed the safety
of Gashurzid from other hostile vessels. A small garrison of AI security
robots guard the starport complex, though the local inhabitants are free to
roam about the facility and some have even found employment there.

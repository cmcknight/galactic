	Iddamakur has had an interesting history. During the rule of the 
Solomani (prior to the First Solomani Rim War), Iddamakur was used as a 
planetary prison for all the "undesirable elements" of the region. Different
populations of dissidents were distributed among the planet's twelve small 
continents and numerous archipelagos; use of technology above TL 4 was 
prohibited, as was sea travel between groups. After the First Solomani Rim 
War, the Imperial government made an effort to assist the economic 
development of the world by constructing a class 'A' starport, which linked 
the relatively more prosperous worlds of Basil and Darrukesh with the rest 
of the sector. The strategy worked, and by 1117, Iddamakur had a tech level
of 8, and was becoming a leading producer of inexpensive, basic consumer 
goods. The Second Solomani Rim War caused a change in production priorities
to items to support the local Imperial war effort. Control of the system
changed hands several times during the war, and the system was in Solomani 
hands at the time of the Collapse. Though not heavily damaged by Virus,
with the markets for its products gone practically overnight, the world 
suffered a severe economic depression which led to political anarchy. 
Today, Iddamakur is balkanized, though the various factions cooperate on 
trade and defense issues. The last three years have seen a dramatic up turn
in Iddamakur’s economic fortunes, as new products and new markets for these 
products (Darrukesh, and other independent "survivor" worlds in adjoining
sectors) have opened up.

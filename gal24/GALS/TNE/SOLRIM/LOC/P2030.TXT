Hades is also rated as an 'Amber' zone because of the Virus that inhabits
the only remaining facility in the system, a refueling station in orbit
around the outer most gas giant. The Virus is quite mentally unstable and
has become convinced that it is Satan (yes, that one), and will broadcast
messages to that effect, along with promises of free fuel if you'll join
its "minions." A favorite for squadron gunnery practice (the station has
absorbed a tremendous amount of damage over the past three years and remains
"alive", a tribute to the naval architects that originally designed it),
"Satan" actually poses little danger to travelers who maintain their distance
and follow standard anti-Virus procedures.

	Hephaistos was one of the few completed terraforming projects in the Third
Imperium. Only adjustments in the biosphere (reductions of the oceans and
atmosphere) were left to be completed when the Second Solomani War broke out.
The Solomani continued the biosphere adjustment work after occupying the system
in 1117 (some Imperial scientists even stayed on to see an end to their hard
work). This effort continued until the Collapse. Though the biosphere is
currently stable, the inhabitants would like to one day further increase the
land to water surface ratio to 20 percent land, 80 percent water. This may not
prove technologically feasible for some time, though Terran Republic
technicians are assisting in the salvage of terraforming equipment.

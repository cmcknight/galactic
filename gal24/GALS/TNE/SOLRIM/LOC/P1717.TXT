Muan Gwi is the homeworld of the Vegans. Though there was a great deal of
damage caused by the Virus, Muan Gwi retained a small number of salvageable
starships, and eventually regained contact with Dingir in 1190. Trade
relations were reestablished soon afterward, and now regular merchant convoys
travel the jump-2 route through the Wilds between Dingir and Muan Gwi. The
government of Muan Gwi maintains a strict non-intervention policy in the
internal affairs of other worlds. This policy has meant that many Vegan
"fallen" worlds are still controlled by individuals who are hostile to the
old ways. The Terrans have exploited this situation by providing support to
anti-Muan Gwi Vegan factions on various worlds. The aim of this policy is to
keep the Vegans from uniting into a regional power which would likely be
hostile to the Terran Republic.

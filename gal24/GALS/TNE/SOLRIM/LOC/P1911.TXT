	The Alpha Ophiuchi system was the site of an Imperial naval depot. 
During the Second Solomani Rim War, Depot served as the primary service 
center for many Imperial starships. This support was critical in allowing 
Imperial and Vegan forces to hold off the numerically superior Solomani 
fleets.

    Sathyos survived the Collapse with a planetary UWP of B479735-9. 
Unfortunately, it sat astride the primary route of travel for Vampire fleets
as they traveled to and from Cymbeline. The stats listed for 1202 are the 
result of the Vampires slowing wearing down Sathyos' defenses, and then 
bombarding the starport complexes and major cities in 1181. It is doubtful 
the world will recover now without outside assistance

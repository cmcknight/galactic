Ys is the site of a Terran Republic outpost (named Outpost Beowulf). The
citizens of Ys were less than enthusiastic about the arrival of Terran
Republic Naval and Marines forces on a permanent basis in their system,
and initially there was some friction between the military and the
civilian populace. Fortunately, a program was started by Outpost Beowulf's
commander to assist the population of Ys in their efforts to rebuild their
world. The program was such a success, it became a model for similar
programs elsewhere.

   The Amir of Azaremiid, a charismatic leader who is in actuality the TED of
the Azaremiid system, at one time controlled a considerable fleet of salvaged
starships which he used to install or support other TEDs in the surrounding
systems (particularly Suleiman and Vanefa, both of which are now hopelessly
balkanized because of the interventions). Ten years ago, Azaremiid tried to
take over the Ai Jabry system, and was rudely surprised to find that the Ai
Jaryians also had a fleet of salvaged ships, which they used to turn back the
invaders from their system. War has continued in an on-again, off-again
fashion ever since, and is gradually wearing down the Azaremiidian forces,
since Azaremiid has no way to construct new starships. Ai Jabry on the other
hand has recently started constructing new ships, and it is only a matter of
time before the Ai Jabryians go over to the offensive.

    The only system in this subsector which retained interstellar capability
through the Collapse is Charuth, which still operates a number of pre-Collapse
starships. Construction began recently on new TL 10 starship designs utilizing
jump drive components from old, no longer functional vessels. Scientists and
engineers are also working to make new jump drive components, and are less
than a year away (provided their supply of lanthanum is not interrupted, see
below) from having this capability once again. UWP stats for Charuth will
then become A7869A7-A.

    Explorers from Charuth have ventured out to a number of local systems
since the Collapse. Though a few vampire ships and free traders have been
encountered, so far no other civilization capable of producing starships has
been found. Many intellectuals on Charuth have begun to theorize that no other
such civilization will be found, as the Collapse has apparently destroyed all
others. This has caused the Charuth government to assume an extremely
cautious approach in sending out exploratory vessels, since if Charuth is the
last of its kind, all starships resources must be husbanded very carefully
until new ones can be constructed in quantity.

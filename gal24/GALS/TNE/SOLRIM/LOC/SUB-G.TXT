Subsector Notes
---------------
	Most of this subsector and the Esperance subsector composed the Vegan
Autonomous District, region of space created by the Imperial government
after the First Solomani Rim War as a counter balance to possible Solomani
aggression. Most worlds within the District are inhabited almost entirely
by Vegans, Shulgiasu and Merganser being the exceptions in this subsector.
Those worlds were colonized by humans because of their high gravity.
Sithuan Hsarr, a high gravity world by Vegan standards, was the site of an
experimental Vegan colony prior to the Collapse.

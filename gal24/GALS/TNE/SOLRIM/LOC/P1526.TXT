Meshan was the scene of the first face-to-face encounter between warships of
the Terran Republic and Dingir League in 1199. A dead world, Meshan was of
interest of both sides because of the potential it had as a place where
valuable relics could be recovered. Unfortunately, both sides started
shooting at each other almost immediately (officially, both sides claimed
that they thought the other was a Vampire fleet). The subsequent battle,
between two Terran Republic starships and five from the Dingir League, ended
in a Dingir victory when one of the Terran starships exploded after a
critical hit to its powerplant section. Subsequent naval activity between
fleets from both sides resulted in a stalemate, and an uneasy truce has
been in force ever since.

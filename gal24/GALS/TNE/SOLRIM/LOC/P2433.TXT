	Smade's Planet was settled by a single family several centuries ago, and
drew in the occasional colonist who wished to get off the beaten path since
then. A recent expedition to the world found no inhabitants, and it is
suspected that either they perished in a vampire ship attack (there is evidence
that a vampire ship did attack the planet) or left their world in search of
what might remain of civilization when news of the Collapse arrived here. The
speculation about their disappearance inspired the recent book "The Smade
Family Saga", which gives a historical account of the Smades and explores
various rumors as to their whereabouts.

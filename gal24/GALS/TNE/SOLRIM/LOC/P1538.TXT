The environment of Vantage is extremely unusual. Its atmosphere, too thick
for humans near the surface, is breathable at high altitudes. Unlike most
such worlds, Vantage has no mountains of sufficient height, and its
Pre-Collapse population lived almost entirely in the air, in cities supported
by contragrav generators. This fact proved fatal to the normal human
inhabitants of the planet during the Collapse, who died when their "cloud
cities" plummeted from the sky and crashed when the Virus struck.

Unknown to even the inhabitants of nearby worlds, however, is the fact that
Vantage still harbors a small humanoid population. In the years leading up to
the Second Solomani Rim War, GenAssist, a Solomani Confederation
biotechnology megacorporation, secretly created genetically altered humans
which had the ability withstand the crushing depths of Vantage's oceans and
which were able to breathe both in the hyperdense atmosphere and underwater
without the assistance of special high tech equipment. GenAssist had hoped
that their new creations would be able to mine the mineral deposits found on
Vantage's ocean bottoms, a venture considered commerically unprofitable up to
that time. A colony of these humans (which call themselves Seetaaneeans)
survived the Collapse and now have a settlement some 5,000 strong which lives
on the ruins of a partially submerged floating city which crashed into a
shallow sea near Vantage's equator.

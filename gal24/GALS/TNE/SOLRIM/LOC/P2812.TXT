	This subsector contains a number of unusual worlds. Nisinasha, like
Easter, is egg-shaped, distorted by tidal forces far in the past, when it 
was much closer to its gas giant primary. Its atmosphere, however, is nearly
spherical, producing near-vacuum at the ends, too-high pressure at the 
middle, and two habitable bands between these extremes.

    Flanders and Bellerophon were both part of the Vegan Autonomous 
District prior to the Collapse even though they were colonized by humans 
(the gravities of these worlds are too high for Vegans to survive unless 
they wear special high tech support gear).The nation-states of Bellerophon 
have recently expressed an interest in joining the Dingir League. While the 
location of Bellerophon (some 5 parsecs from Dingir, nearly surrounded by 
Vegan inhabited worlds) presented a political dilemma at first, it has been 
decided that membership in the League should be granted in the coming year, 
especially in light of Muan Gwi's announced recantation of any claim to the
region.

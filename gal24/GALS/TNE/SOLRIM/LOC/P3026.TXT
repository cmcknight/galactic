Thorwald is the home of one of the most unusual plant forms known: the leyden
tree. The tree secretes an internal metal lightning rod, and when lightning
strikes, the charge is deflected through a net of filaments into cellular
capacitors, where it is used to convert organic molecules from low to high
energy forms, supplementing photosynthesis as an energy source. An electrical
storm over a leyden forest is a spectacular sight, best viewed from a safe
distance.

Terran Republic expeditions arrived at Ganesh and Catania late last 
year, and already large numbers of the inhabitants have converted to the 
Gabreelist faith.  Unfortunately, the forces of the Republic are unaware of 
the existence of the Vampire highway that runs through much of this 
subsector. The inhabitants of Ganesh and Catania are equally oblivious, 
since they have been essentially left alone by the Vampire fleets that pass 
through, and haven't had space flight capability since the Collapse. 

It is only a matter of time before a vampire ship or ships pass through 
the Ganesh or Catania system and detect the presence of the Terrans. It is 
also highly probable that Terran Republic Naval Scouts will stumble across a
large Vampire fleet in route to or away from Cymbeline as they move deeper 
into the subsector in search of rumored "Hiver client-states" that lie 
coreward (such expeditions have already been planned). In either case, 
hostilities are almost certain to break out when the two groups encounter 
each other.

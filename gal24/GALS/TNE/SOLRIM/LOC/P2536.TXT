	Carchemish housed a Solomani Research Station prior to the Collapse. The
nature of the experiments that went on there has never been fully ascertained,
as records of such projects are now impossible to find, however it is known
that GenAssist was involved. Extreme caution should be exercised when visiting
this system.

    Kesirisu maintained a class 'C' starport facility after the Collapse 
until a few decades ago when a Vampire fleet raid destroyed most of the 
facilities and carted off the rest (these components were later used to 
upgrade Gashurzid's starport, unknown to that world's inhabitants). The 
inhabitants of Kesirisu have since become extremely xenophobic, and will 
resist all attempts to contact them.

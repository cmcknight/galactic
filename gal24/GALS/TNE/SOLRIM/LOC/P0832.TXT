Thalassa recently annexed Wallach, and began establishing a colony there.
The population of Wallach is happy to have an infusion of new blood into its
small population (which is relatively speaking, aging rapidly), and Thalassa
obtains valuable raw materials, and an outlet for its young, growing
population.

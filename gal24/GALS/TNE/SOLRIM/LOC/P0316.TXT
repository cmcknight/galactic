	Only one world in this subsector has retained an interstellar 
capability, that being Finnegans, which still has two 200-ton far traders in
operation. Both these craft (the Lucky Seven and the Katherine Anne) are 
cared for by the people of Finnegans with the same reverence normally 
reserved for royalty (a daily cleaning by a dedicated staff while in port is
but just one example of the meticulous care given the ships). Currently the 
mission of the far traders is to take messages and small packages back and 
forth between the high population worlds of this subsector. Finnegans is 
more than adequately compensated by the high population worlds for this 
service, which would go far in explaining why the captain's chairs have 
inlays of gold and precious gems. No amount of ornamentation, however, would
stop jump drives of the ships from eventually breaking down from lack of a 
proper maintenance overhaul, which as far as anyone on Finnegans knows, 
hasn't been completed in over 70 years.  
	In fact, the ships are better maintained than it would first appear. 
Both the captain of the Lucky Seven and the Katherine Anne discovered the 
existence of the starport in the Cuchulain system a number of years ago, a 
fact they are keeping from the people of this subsector. Both captains fear 
losing their monopoly on interstellar trade, and the exorbitantly high fees 
they now command. They keep curious traders from the Esperance subsector and
elsewhere from visiting by spreading rumors about a massive Vampire fleet 
which patrols the Alderamin subsector looking for ships to infect or 
destroy--and back up this claim by periodically "damaging" their own ships 
and bringing them to Cuchulain for repairs.

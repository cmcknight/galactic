Hamilcar is a water world notable because it is home to large colonies
(4 million or so individuals each) of both sentient and non-sentient dolphins.
The sentient dolphins were manipulated to intelligence by GenAssist, which
conducted the experiment with great success a number of years ago. Other
sentient creatures resulting from GenAssist experiments (some based on
pre-existing Terran lifeforms, others completely new creations) will likely
be encountered as the Republic's explorers push deeper into the former
Solomani Confederation.

	Greenpernt (formerly New Greenpernt) is the site of an active corsair base.
Until recently the pirates (which call themselves the Warriors of the Divine)
concentrated primarily on shipping to and from Chernozem, but now have become
bolder and conducted a raid in late 1201 on Remulak, a world within Terran
Republic space. The Terran Navy is expected to mount an effort to suppress the
pirate band once and for all within the next few months.

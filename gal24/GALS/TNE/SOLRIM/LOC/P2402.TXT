    Estigarribia is a balkanized world which was subject to numerous vampire
raids over a period of several decades (the last one occurred in 1188). Four
years ago, the first Charuthian starship visited Estigarribia. At first
thought to be yet another vampire raider, it took months of negotiations and
several more trips before the Charuthians were permitted to land. Trade
relations have since been established between Charuth and several of the
governments on Estigarribia, who became client states. Among the raw materials
the Charuthian merchants trade high tech goods for is lanthanum, which is
critical in the construction of jump drives. The contact between Charuth and
its allies on Estigarribia has not escaped the notice of a few powerful,
extremely xenophobic nation-states located there, which are plotting to stop
all contact with the off-worlders. Opinion is divided as to what to do about
this on Charuth, since Charuth needs the raw materials it is getting from
Estigarribia, but Charuth lacks the interstellar capability necessary to
conduct a large-scale planetary invasion or provide large amounts of high
tech weapons to its allies.

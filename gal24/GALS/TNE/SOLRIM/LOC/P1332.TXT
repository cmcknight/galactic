The Terran Republic has established an outpost (named Outpost Artemis) in the
Mirabilis system. Terran forces were invited to establish the base two years
ago after the leader of Mirabilis, Roger Gleesen, converted to the Gabreelist
faith. The Terran government is now working with the local populace to raise
their level of technology and improve their infrastructure.

Subsector Notes
---------------
	The Sol subsector is a large island of human civilization, in spite of
its proximity to Cymbeline.  Astrography has helped to play a part in this
(the subsector cannot be accessed by starships with anything less than a
jump-3 drive unless they enter through the Dingir subsector), but so has
the efforts of the Terran Republic Navy, which since the founding of the
Republic, has fought a constant battle to rid the subsector of Virus.

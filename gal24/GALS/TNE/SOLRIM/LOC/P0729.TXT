Dingir League merchants and traders from the independent worlds visit most
of the populated systems in this subsector (those worlds that have at least
a starport of 'E'). One of the exceptions is Edaazun, which is home to a
large band of so-called "pirates." They are so-called "pirates" because they
are in reality what's left of the Solomani Confederation 43rd Fleet, which
called Edaazun its homeport as the Second Solomani Rim War wound down. The
group, which still calls itself "The 43rd", consists of personnel who are
either actual crew members (only a few of these are left), the descendants
of crew members, recruits from Edaazun, or marauders and genuine pirates who
have joined The 43rd over the years. The 43rd has a number of vintage
Solomani warships (mostly frigates or smaller types) the largest of which,
the Mistral, is a 100,000 ton battleship which is restricted to the Edaazun
system because of a damaged (beyond all repair) jump drive. The 43rd is
naturally very hostile to any vessel which comes from the worlds that used to
make up the Imperial/Vegan Enclave, but have also been known to confiscate
cargo from other ships if they believe that cargo was bound for a former
Imperial/Vegan Enclave port. Ships from The 43rd operate in twos or threes
within four parsecs of Edaazun, though they have been spotted further afield
on rare occasions. To combat this threat to its shipping, the Dingir League
has set up a convoy system to protect merchants, and established a naval
base at Duriim.

   The world Easter is notable astronomically because of its unusual shape,
which vaguely resembles an egg. This was caused in the distant past by strong
gravitational influences on the planet. The inhabitants of Easter live in the
broad bands of territory located in the world’s temperate zones which have
breathable atmosphere year round.

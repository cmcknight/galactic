	Cuchulain survived the Collapse with comparatively minor damage in 
relation to other nearby worlds. When contacted by Dingir, it was 
immediately offered membership in the Dingir League, but turned it down in 
favor of an independent course. Cuchulain merchants can be found engaging in
trade with most of the populated worlds in the former Vegan Autonomous 
District (they are the chief rival of Muan Gwi's merchants in the region), 
as well as the Dingir League and the independent world of Ishkur, where they
sometimes interact with merchants from the Terran Republic.

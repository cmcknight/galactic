The Loki system has been officially designated a 'Red' zone by the Terran
Republic government due to the presence of Vampire ships. The three vessels,
a Solomani Hood-class heavy cruiser and two destroyers were once part of a
larger vampire fleet which passed through the system during the 1140s on its
way to the Terran system. Apparently the ships experienced some sort of jump
drive failure, probably due to lack of maintenance, and were unable to
continue. The ships patrol regularly back and forth between the system's two
gas giants, and will attack any vessel that is within range. The first
Terran exploratory ship to enter the system was destroyed and its crew
killed. A second ship and crew, sent to find out what happened to the first,
only just managed to escape with their lives and the above information.
Since the system holds little of any real value, the Terran Republic Navy
has by-passed it for now, hoping the heavy crusier will suffer some further
disabling malfunction before they attempt to finish it off.

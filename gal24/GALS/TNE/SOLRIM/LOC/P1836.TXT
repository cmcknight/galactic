Chernozem is the last remaining Bootean world that maintained acapability
to construct new space hulls (but not starships). Primarily a world of
merchants, Chernozem has over the last couple of decades amassed a
considerable system defense force. This has made the main world safe from
pirate raids, but the merchant fleet is still being slowly depleted by
pirates. So far, the Chernozem merchants have been able to replace their
losses by purchasing new starship components from the Terran Republic, but
the director of the Bureau of Defense wants to take a more aggressive tact
against the pirate threat.

Subsector Notes
---------------
	This subsector was far from the major trade routes before the Second
Solomani Rim War, and generally lagged behind the rest of the sector
economically. Imperial efforts to open up the subsector to more economic
development met with some success, though many worlds remained disadvantaged.

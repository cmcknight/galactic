Arrukir is the site of a Terran Republic outpost (Outpost Odysseus), and
serves as both a jump off point for expeditions further coreward, and as a
training center for Vegan operatives in Terran employ. The conversion of a
handful of Vegans on this world to Gabreelism has presented the Faith with a
controversy. A vocal minority of priests on Arrukir want to limit conversions
to humans only, and has taken the matter to Terra for discussion. While
there is precedent for allowing other species into the Faith (Priestess
Gabree-el granted special dispensations to both sentient Dolphins and Terran
Hivers because they were declared "culturally human"), the ramifications of
allowing the Vegans with their own distinct non-human culture to be part of
the Faith are being carefully examined by the leadership.

Lamarck is notable not for its usual planetary features but because it has
managed against the odds to continue to travel amongst the stars. Though
technologically left relatively backward (an average tech level of 7), it has
still manages to engage in low level trade with other systems via its small
fleet of improvised starships. A typical example is the Mantangue, a standard
design Imperial far trader that employs a solar sail to maneuver to its jump
point. Ships from Lamarck (and nearby Jorjor) recently began exploring the
spinward portions of the Alpha Leonis Sector in hopes of finding spare parts
for their starships and other worlds with which to engage in trade.

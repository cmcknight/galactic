
Quinoid Subsector
-----------------

Quinoid subsector has a New Era population of just over 19.1 billion, a
decline of over 111 billion from its pre-Collapse population. Its highest
population is 8 million, at Talien and Estrem, and its highest tech level is
9, at Paragon, Sternway, Montero, Palique, and Darius. Because this
subsector is so rich in habitable worlds, ten worlds have actually
experienced a population increase over their pre-Collapse levels: Paragon,
Sternway, Kase, Montero, Margate, Issek, Palique, Trevor, Sardis, and Darius.
The high tech worlds of Quinoid were hit particularly hard by Virus,
consequently there are a large number of balkanized worlds  and worlds ruled
by TED's.

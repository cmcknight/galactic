        Kruyter was a minor crossroad in the pre-war era, not even important
enough to attack. It emerged from the Final War unscathed, but Virus changed 
that.  Virus scoured all life from the system.  The system
was left untouched by human hands for seventy years.  In 1200, Kruytercorp
was formed to bring life to the system.  The corporation was privately funded,
one of the first corporations with a stock offering on the new RC wide stock 
exchange. The RC is the major stockholder, other stockholders include
Transstar, and Glanow Trust on Oriflamme, and Meldarr Holding on Eos.
        Kruytercorp has rebuilt the starport and it is a a major stopover
for ships travelling from Aubaine subsector to Oriflamme subsector.  It
also has many prospectors searching the asteroid belt for valuable minerals
and for relic technology.  So far the search has gone badly.  Kruytercorp has
spent a great deal of capital on rebuilding the starport, so far this 
has not shown a profit, and the prospecting division is hemoraging red ink
badly.
        The prospectors are a very eclectic group of individuals.  They were
drawn from every Coalition world, and possess a vast array of beliefs, values 
and ideas on how the future should unfold.  There has been some talk of what
to do if Kruytercorp goes under, but so far the prospectors are undecided.

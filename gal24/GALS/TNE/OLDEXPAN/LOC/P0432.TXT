CIN/Aubaine, 1/IV, 1202

     McKenzie Holdings, a salvage company registered out of Aubaine, has
     formally established a legal claim to Adrian (0432/Aubaine; new UWP is
     D426112-9). The new starport is class D, and was expanded from a
     former class G spaceport. The new starport has a few repair bays
     capable of handling small ships (200 tons or less). Refined fuel is
     available at the starport, as well as lodging and food. Currently,
     about 30 sentients permanently live at McKenzie Station.

     McKenzie Holdings has provided RCES with a small facility for use as a
     scout base, at no cost to RCES. They have also formally petitioned for
     status as a client-state of the RC.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
McKenzie Holdings makes most of its money at Adrian by salvaging the relic
TL-14 equipment. They also make some money servicing the ships going
between Fija and Eos and Nike Nimbus (as the shortest route from Fija to
either of these worlds is by way of Adrian).

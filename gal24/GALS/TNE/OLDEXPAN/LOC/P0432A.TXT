Technical Details


McKenzie Station is mostly underground, and is divided into several
"blocks" (sections). These blocks were not built all at the same time.
Rather, a block was built or upgraded as needed. Tunnels average 2.8 meters
high and 2.5 meters wide (7 m^2 cross-sectional area).

McKenzie Station is comprised of the following "blocks" (sections):

As stated previously, McKenzie Station (a class D starport) was expanded
from a former class G spaceport. The former space port consisted of two
runways, six basic hangar pits (see below) in a radial arrangement, an
underground fuel bunker (see below) and a control/administration building.

In early 1201, they renovated all six of the hangar pits and used a
"seeker" (modified scout/courier) for the power supply, sensors & commo
gear, and living quarters. They used up a small relic TL-14 fusion reactor
for the 1.152 MW of power needed whenever the "seeker" had to leave.

In mid-1201, they finished the first vehicle hangar & repair bay, giving
them a permanent power supply and living quarters, regardless of however
many ships were there. They renovated the underground fuel bunker and
finished a fuel refinery.

In late 1201, they enclosed one of the hangar pits, which allowed for
repairs or maintenance to be performed on a ship while in a "shirt sleeves"
environment. They also finished the second vehicle hangar & repair bay as
well as two apartment blocks.

In early 1202, they enclosed another hangar pit, and they finished another
apartment block and the TL-12 command center. They also excavated another
six basic hangar pits (in another radial arrangement) on the other side of
a runway. They decided to give three of the new hangars to RCES for use as
a scout base. They also finished another underground fuel bunker.

Hangar "Pit"

Consists of a 1,000 dt hangar "pit" as well as 100 dt of access tunnels
around the pit itself and connecting to the main complex. The pit is open
to the air and built at TL-9

The hangar pit is 44.8 meters long, 25 meters wide, and 12.5 meters deep.

Command Center

Because of the critical need for high-tech sensors and communications gear,
they built the command center using TL-12 components instead of the more
readily available TL-9 components. Also, they included a small TL-12 fuel
refinery to serve as a backup refinery in case the primary is ever
unavailable.

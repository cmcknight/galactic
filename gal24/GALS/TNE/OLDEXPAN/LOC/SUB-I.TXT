
Thoezennt Subsector
-------------------   

Thoezennt subsector has a New Era population of just over 1.78 billion, a
decline of over 86.2 billion from its pre-Collapse population. Its highest
population is 800 million, at Hodg, and its highest tech level is A(10),
also at Hodg.  Six worlds have actually experienced a population increase
over their pre collapse levels: Hodg, Lote, Bwan Murr, Sauler, Meadsk, and
Coaise.  This subsector displays some of the worse effects of the Collapse -
many world are balkanized, have a TED, or both.  Although the TED of Hodg
does not have starfaring capability, his relatively high tech level could
make him a dangerous opponent of the Coalition.

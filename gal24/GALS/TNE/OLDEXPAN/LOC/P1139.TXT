        Shenadoah weathered the Collapse rather well.  It didn't
suffer a major population die off, the economy was the only thing that was
heavily damaged.  The sustainable technology level fell to 5, but
recent work has raised it to 6.  The citizens are very friendly and take
a great deal of pride in being a member of the Coalition.  Many young
people have joined the RCES and the RCN.  Almost all residents 
try to be involved in their community, many spend their free time reading
up on planetary and RC politics and policies.  One of the most popular
activities is arguing about politics.

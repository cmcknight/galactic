
Dethenes Subsector
------------------

Dethenes subsector has a New Era population of just over 78.9 billion,
a decline of over 123 billion from its pre-Collapse population. Its highest
population is 70 billion, at Dethenes, and its highest tech level is 10(A),
also at Dethenes.  Only two worlds have actually experienced a population
increase over their pre-Collapse levels: Larmix and Styge.  After a series
of Vampire wars on Larspri, one Virus strain came to dominate, and has
built a robotic society from the surviving robots.

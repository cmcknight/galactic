
Ile Subsector:
--------------

Ile subsector has a New Era population of just over 596 million, a decline of
over 39.5 billion from its pre-Collapse population. Its highest population
is 400 million, at Torrel, and its highest tech level is 9, at Yesta.  Four
worlds have actually experienced a population increase over their
pre-Collapse levels: Warner, Fentel, Srzilkrozia, and Kresh. However, the
apparent population increase at Kresh is due to the thousands of Naval and
Scout personnel stranded at that world by the Collapse. The population of
Kresh is descended from those personnel, and their government is set up with
a very military structure.  There are several uninfected starships in orbit
about or landed on The Edge.  Their crews had been killed by the Tarlant's
hallucinogenic effect, and the ships ran out of power plant fuel before the
Virus could strike.

In the rebellion the only people with reason to visit this world were, by 
and large, the Navy and Scouts. The Naval Base was large, and provided 
support and co-ordination for the Colonial Squadrons in their quadrant of 
the Expanses. The Scout Base's role was ecological survey of the area, and 
this was wound down as the Rebellion dragged on. Margaret's faction 
maintained the Navy Base there through the Hard Times, but it was a shadow 
of it's former strength when the Virus destroyed it in the collapse. The
Technocrats who ruled the world for the navy were replaced by the remnants 
of the navy left on the planet, who managed to organise the people into a 
cohesive government that encompassed the whole world. Apart from the 
construction of a 'D' class port by the VTA there has been little trade 
save that in relics recovered from the ruins of the Naval Base. Still, 
Scout teams have raised the tech level from 4 to 5 in the last 7 years, and
hope to integrate some of Voskl's TL-9 equipment into the infrastructure 
when it becomes surplus.

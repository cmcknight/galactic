	On 05/I/1202 Baldur started a colonization effort on this world. They 
have sent several thousand colonists to this new planet.  Oriflamme has 
helped by supplying farmers.  This is part of a joint effort to expand the
rimward portion of the Coalition.  It will also supply Baldur with much 
needed agricultural imports.
 
	Poyzen, the colony site, is unusual in planetological terms, in that it
originally had an atmosphere classified as tainted, due to volcanic
pollutants in its atmosphere. However, the world's volcanism has passed into
a dormant phase, and the planet's atmosphere has cleaned itself up to the
point where it is no longer rated as tainted. The world is thought to be
uninhabited, having only been the site of a Last Imperium scout base
destroyed in the Collapse.
	
    Actually the planet is occupied by a few hundred decendents of the 
Scout Base's staff.  They are very primitive, TL 0 with a few relic
weapons, the most important of which is a relic laser rifle.  The 
tribe's chief possesses this.

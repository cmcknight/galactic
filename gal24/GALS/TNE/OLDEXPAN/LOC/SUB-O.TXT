
So Skire Subsector
------------------

So Skire subsector has a New Era population of just over 1.7
billion, a decline of over 21.7 billion from its pre-Collapse
population. Its highest population is 700 million, at Cobham, and
its highest tech level is 9, also at Cobham.  Six worlds have
actually experienced a population increase over their pre-Collapse
levels: Peart, Janazzo, Pohl, Patuxant, Clarke, and Wildman.  Ships
transiting between Sitah and the Reformation Coalition pass through
the central worlds of So Skire.  Consequently the sites for most of
the Hiver temporary bases are also here.

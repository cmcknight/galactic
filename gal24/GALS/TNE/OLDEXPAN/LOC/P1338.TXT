        Spencer is only the second world to be forcibly integrated into
the Coalition.  Oriflamme signed a mutual security agreement with a small
nation in the Southern chain of islands in 1198.  Over the last three years
Oriflamme built up its strenth. In late 1201 they launched a suprise 
attack against the other nations on the planet.  Within three months
they had defeated all large military units on the planet.  Since then
they have been conducting mop up operations. Casulaties have been heavy, 
a suprisingly strong resistance movement has sprung up.  They are well
equipped and willing to die for their cause.  Many on Oriflamme suspect
that the rebels are getting off planet help.

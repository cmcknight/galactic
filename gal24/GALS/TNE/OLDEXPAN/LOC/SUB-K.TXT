
Karse Subsector:
----------------

Karse subsector has a New Era population of just over 1.69 billion, a decline
of almost 183 billion from its pre-Collapse population.  Its highest
population is 800 million, at Ropram, and its highest tech level is 8, at
Letron, Traynos, and Karse.  Six worlds have actually experienced a
population increase over their pre-Collapse levels: Mager, Bytor, Ramaka,
Traynos, Kolop, and Quest.  The research team that was studying the minor
alien race on Gonzu was stranded by the Collapse. Their eventual death of old
age was the only notice that this low tech race even had of the Collapse.
The Gonzans have legends of a human child who still lives among the people.

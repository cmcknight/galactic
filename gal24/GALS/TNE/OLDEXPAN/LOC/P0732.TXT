        In antebellum times, the world of Hite, was ruled by a dictator
by the name of Crystal DeAmberville.  Hite was hit hard by the Final War,
and then even worse by Virus.  As the ruins of the capital lay burning, a 
mob broke into the presidental palace and tore DeAmberville to pieces.  
Many things can be said of DeAmberville, but one thing is for sure, she
created a massive high quality bureaucracy to carry out her orders. 
After her death, the bureaucracy continued to function.  As it was one
of the few remaining institutions on the planet, it was able to organize
food shipments and begin to rebuild the planet.  
        In 1195 Hivers came to the planet and found a planet still
struggling with the rebuilding effort. The planet became a member of
the new Dawn League and after a planet wide contest changed its name
to Nike Nimbus, after an ancient Terran goddess of victory.  
        The Nimbians feel strongly that the most important thing about
the Coalition is that it is rebuilding civilization.  The petty political
arguments of the Assembly of Worlds don't help anyone.  Even though
their planet is still trying to rebuild, the Nimbians have formed several
corporations to go out into the Wilds and help rebuild civilization.

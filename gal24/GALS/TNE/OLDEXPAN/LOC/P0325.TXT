Bwan Murr has no working spacecraft but does have a working albiet primitive
planetary defense system, which consists of planetary radar sites and
ballistic missles.  The government is a run by the Reverend Desmond

servants.  The government treats its populace pretty well, it just attempts
to kill strangers on sight.

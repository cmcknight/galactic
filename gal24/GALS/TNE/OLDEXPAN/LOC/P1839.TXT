	The Templars have taken over the planet Wrangell. They have convinced
several hundred of the locals to grow food for the Templars. In exchange the
Templars promise protection against the rampagings of Virus, they also offer
agricultural improvements, and high tech devices such as fire arms.  The
Templars have also started a school for the children of the locals.  This
is not a very elaborate affair, but the Templars hope that they can educate
the populace so that it can serve as source of educated recruits.  Many of
the locals are work for the Templars, as cooks, janitors, and other menial
jobs.  This frees up more Templars to serve in an active combat role.

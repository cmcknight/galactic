On 2/I/1202 the RCSA announced the establishment of a new bootstrap 
project in the So Skire subsector, on the trailing face of the Coalition. 
This bootstrap operation is unusual in that it is being backed by joint RC 
resources, but is outside of the Primary Area of Operations mandated for 
such joint operations.

        Before the Collapse over seven billion people lived on Oriflamme.
A vast network of robotic farms fed the masses.  When Virus struck, it
possessed thousands of these farms, and turned the robotic workers into
roving death machines.  Hundreds of millions died by the hands of these 
robotic killing machines.  Even more died of starvation, in the next few
years, as people struggled to produce food, with primitive non-mechanical 
means.  It wasn't just people who died, the basic trust in your fellow man 
died; compassion, charity and kindness all died.  When it was a choice
between feeding your child, or a stranger, the stranger went hungry.  
        The situation on Oriflamme began to turn around, in late 1165,
when the first of the Technarchs emerged.  They promised to feed those
who would swear alliegence to them.  They than began to secure other
basic industries, until they controlled the entire planet.  
        The scars of the collapse are still on the psyche of the residents
of Oriflamme.  Life is cheap on Oriflamme, and only those who are strong
survive. Oriflamme is very interested in expanding the Coalition, but
under Oriflamme control.

        Vezina was the first world to be conqured by the Coalition.  The
actual conquest was quite by accident.  The largest TED on the planet 
seized the Aurora, one of the Twelve.   In 1199 the Lirgishkhunan and the 
Ashtabula launched a rescue raid which inadverently toppled the government.
After this the other TEDs on the planet surrendered. 
        The RC has placed a group of RCSA officials in charge of the planet
Several bootstrap missions are in place, and a great deal of relic 
technology is being recovered.  The people of Vezina are generally happy 
with the conquest, the TEDs were not popular, and the RC is improving living 
conditions immensly.  A few primitive neo-tribal societies are resisting the 
Coalition, they are proving more a nuisance, than a threat.

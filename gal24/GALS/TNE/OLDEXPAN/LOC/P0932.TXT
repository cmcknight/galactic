        Before the Collapse Enkidu was named Dono.  It was owned by a council
of five corporations.  These weren't megacorporations, just small planetary
companies.  They were Westlake Industries, Mogon Technologies, Cynder Data
Systems, United Power Systems, and Blenkindo Enterprises.  Each corporation
had its own territory, and used it to produce products for export throughout 
the subsector.   The corporations were formed by residents of L'Streich,
and it and its related worlds formed a large proporation of Dono's market.
        During fighting between the Solomani Confederation and Lucan's
Imperium, the planet's infrastructure was damaged beyond repair.  The five 
corporations banded togethor to evacuate the planet.  Unfortunately five 
million people is beyond the scope of anyone to evacuate, the corporations
managed to get a mere thirty thousand to saftey, before the planet died.
        The survivors fled to Hite (now known as Nike Nimbus), where they 
kept alive the dream of someday returning to their homes.  The first generation
of refugees died without fufilling their dream. Today their grandchildren are finally
able to return home.  The five corporations were able to stay intact on Hite,
and on the founding of the Dawn League, began making plans to return home.  
        On 17-IV-1199 the first expatriarts returned home.  They renamed the
planet Enkidu, to symbolize the hope they felt for the future. Right now
life is difficult; its not easy rebuilding a world, but by working togethor
the residents will build a new future.

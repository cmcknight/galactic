         The people of Fija crave order.  They are uncomfortable with things
which do not follow detailed plans.  This enabled them to survive the Collapse
without the patterns of mass riotings, martial law, and mass executions which 
many worlds suffered under.  The people simply refused to fall under the sway
of such chaos.  Fija was an original member of the Dawn League and 
the earliest proponent for creating the Reformation Coalition.  
Most residents feel that the RC has not gone far enough, too much is still left
to chance.  Without careful planning, many efforts will be wasted and lives 
will be thrown away for little gain.  If the Coalition would restructure 
itself, it could apply precious resources for maximum gain. 
        The governing of Fija is divided up into small bureaus each charged
with a specific task.  Each bureau is run by a different group of technocrats.
The bureaus come under review each ten years.  At this time any group can
bid for control of the bureau.  The selection is decided by an impartial
group of judges.  A great deal of political intrigue surrounds the 
selection process.

        Zloga is yet another boneyard world, the Final War destroyed
its life support systems.  Zloga was actually named Saloga before the
Collapse, but tech prospectors returning to the world misread the 
original name, and it has since been known as Zloga.  There is a small
community of tech prospectors on the planet.   They have a small 
habitat, from which they make forays into the dead cities.  Any
issues effecting the community is decided by a vote of all residents
over the age 14.

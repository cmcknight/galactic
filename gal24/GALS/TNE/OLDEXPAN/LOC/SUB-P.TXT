Sitah Subsector
---------------
Sitah subsector (renamed from Bascoj) has a New Era population of just over 
8.7 billion, a decline of over 414 billion from its pre-Collapse population.
Its highest population is 8 billion, at Renj, and its highest tech level is 
11(B) also at Renj. Three worlds have actually experienced a population 
increase over their pre-Collapse levels: Surren, Miisha, and Osmosis.  A 
population has been restored to several worlds which serve as way 
stations for traffic through the region.  Darinov and New Luck are not 
listed as cemetery worlds, because they did not have a pre-Collapse 
population.

The Hivers have developed a region within this subsector to serve as one 
of the stepping stones between the Federation and the Reformation Coalition.
 As such, Sitah, as the region is known, has benefited from Hiver
technology, and the worlds of the region trade amongst themselves, but do 
not have the means to extend commerce beyond their borders. The worlds are 
not organized on an interstellar level, in fact the name is not really an 
official one, but rather a term derived from a child's  game which means 
"safe place". A few elements of the Federation Navy patrol these worlds as 
a defense against Vampires.

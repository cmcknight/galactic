        Aubaine is a water world, with most human civilization located on
the many small islands that dot the ocean.  Aubaine is the true home of
the Schalli, who are known by that name due to political wrangling in the Last
Imperium, which denied that the Schalli were truly intelligent.  Anyone
who has seen the Schalli at work, knows that is a lie.
Aubaine is the seat of the Coalition government, the Assembly of Worlds is
located on the largest island group.  Here represenitives from each Coalition
world gather to decided issues effecting the future.  
        The Aubaine is also site of the Hiver Technical Accademy, and
the Aubani are very close to the Hivers.  The Aubani have a vision for the
future, that has the Coalition expanding across the wreckage of the Imperium.
Other Coalition members feel that the Aubani are arrogant, but the Aubani
deny this saying that only they can see how the Coalition is a small island
of sanity in the vast oceans of space, and that it could easily be swept 
away by the rising tide of chaos. Aubaine is the center of the Federalist 
movement.
        Aubiane was orignally ruled by a monarchy, but in the last few
centuries, it has been replaced by a civil service bureacracy.  The monarchy
still exists, but has no power beyond ceremonial.  The nobility has is
still rather powerful socially, and a noble title helps opens doors.  In
recent years it has become quite fashionable to buy noble titles from destitute
noble families.

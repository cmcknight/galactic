        Thousands of Schalli were brought to Schall in Imperial times, to 
study them away from their native home on Vras (Aubaine).  During the Collapse
the native humans learned that the Schalli were truly intelligent.  The
Schalli helped the humans survive, but were not interested in getting more
involved with human society. The Schalli on Aubani are very interested in 
going to the stars, while those on Schall tend to be very conservative and
traditional.  Not many Schalli from Schall have joined interstellar 
society. Many Coalition residents, especially those from Lucifer come
to Schalli to experience the Schalli culture in its pure unspoiled state.
        The government is the only Feudal Technocracy in the Federalist
camp.  The people like their government, but don't believe that it is would
be best for everyone.  Every world is different and should come up with a 
system that works for that world.

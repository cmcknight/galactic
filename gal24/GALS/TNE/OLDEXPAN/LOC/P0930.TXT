Like Berkin, Welch was subjected to nuclear bombardament during the
Collapse, losing over 99% of its population to the bombs, radiation
poisoning, disease and starvation during the subsequent nuclear winter. In
the aftermath, the world followed the usual post-Collapse pattern,
fragmenting into a seething nest of competing TEDs, most no more than
bandits or local gangs.

In 1187 Welch was finally reunified under one ruler, however after a brief
reign of four years he was assassinated, and one of his lieutenants, the
self-styled Lord Gaskin, assumed control. He has maintained a firm grip on
power ever since, and shows no sign of losing it anytime soon.

Welch Government Values:

     Corruption: High
     Talent: High
     Cruelty: Moderate
     Aggression: High
     Paranoia/Xenophobia: High

Adventure Ideas:

Face it, this place is a dead loss. Gaskin isn't interested in allowing
RCES bootstrap teams in to improve his people's standard of living, he
isn't interested in negotiating long-term trade and technical assistance
treaties, and he certainly isn't interested in stepping down in favour of a
more representative form of government which will guide his people towards
reintegrating into interstellar society. What little off-world trade he
does allow is typicly for weapons, or luxury goods for him and his cronies
- and few traders are willing to risk having their ship siezed or pay the
rather steep tarrifs he imposes.

One long-term adventure here is to infiltrate onto Welch with the aim of
setting up a pro-RC resistance movement which can then step into power when
the RC topples Gaskin and his "army".


Srys Subsector
-------------- 

Syrs subsector has a New Era population of just over 8.15 billion, a decline
of over 56.5 billion from its pre-Collapse population. Its highest population
is 2 billion, at Syrs, and its highest tech level is 8, at Exage and
Sarcathon.  Three worlds have actually experienced a population increase
over their pre-Collapse levels: Ranb, Sarcathon, and Zinorow. The Droyne on
Yeroltoy have eliminated the small human population that was on that world.

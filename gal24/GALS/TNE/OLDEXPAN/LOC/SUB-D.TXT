
Rusco Subsector
---------------

The 1200 population is 3.43 billion people.  The highest population is
800 million at Voskl, also site of the highest Tech level 9.  The
subsector is home to the Voskl Trade Union.  

The Voskl Trade Alliance (VTA) is a loose confederation of worlds in the 
Voskl subsector (D) of the Old Expanses. The primary aim of the alliance 
is to strengthen the economies and raise the technological level of it's 
member states.It's primary member is Voskl itself.

Voskl's view of the Alliance's future is that it will continue to trade
hi-tech equipment to the other members, slowly raising their TL, whilst 
theirs races ahead with the relic technology they obtain in return. There 
isn't much the rest of the alliance can do to oppose Voskl, but Dycarl sees 
itself as outstripping Voskl in tech level in a decade or so, given their 
original high level. They will not oppose Voskl openly, but hope to launch 
their own recovery missions into the wilds in time. Voskl's primary aim is 
to secure proper spaceship, and eventually starship production

        Trybecorp LIC has owned Trybec since 503, when Trybecorp bought
the planet from a destitute noble family, and then renamed the planet after
itself. Trybecorp was a minor corporation in the Imperium, never near 
megacorporation status, its influence extended over most of Diaspora and 
the Old Expanses.  Trybecorp's major products include computer hardware,
grav vehicles, farm equipment and heavy factory machinery.  The company
used Trybec as a manufacturing center and as a profit making enterprise
in its own right.  
        The Collapse crippled Trybecorp, cutting it off from its suppliers
and markets.  Also large elements of the corporation were destroyed in the
Final War and during the collapse.  Since the founding of the Dawn League, 
Trybecorp has been very interested in expanding  civilization.  It funded 
the construction of Dawn Base, funded half of the Dawn League Scouts and 
urged the creation and expansion of the RCES. When the Twelve were lost, 
it was a terrible blow to the citizens of Trybec, but they have resolved
to struggle on.

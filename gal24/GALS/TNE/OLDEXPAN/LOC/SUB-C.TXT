
Ahrhi Subsector
---------------

Ahrhi subsector has a New Era population of just over 425 million, a decline
of over 72.4 billion from its pre-Collapse population. Its highest population
is 100 million, at Algren, and its highest tech level is 8, at Drand. Two
worlds have actually experienced a population increase over their
pre-Collapse levels: Algren and Drand.  The people of Louks have mangaged to
survive at a level just below their pre-Collapse level in spite of an unusual
atmospheric condition.

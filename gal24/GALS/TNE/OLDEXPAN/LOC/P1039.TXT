        Before the Final War Luhtala, as it was then called, was home to 
millions of anarchists and mystics.  During the collapse, the Luhtalans were
forced to create a minimal amount of government to deal with the destruction of
the interstellar infrastructure.  Many of the anarchists were upset about 
this, but they were persuaded before the argument became violent. Many did
not pay much attention to the government after it was formed, and let it
go about its business in peace.  It keeps society running, and doesn't
interfere with the day to day life of most residents.  After being
contacted by the emerging Dawn League, Luhtala petitioned to join, and
changed its name to Lucifer.  
        The residents of Lucifer, who are still called Luhtalans, have
a wild streak. They are still reluctant to follow orders from governments or
anyone for that matter.  There are still thousands of cults and mystic 
religons active on the planet. Now that interstellare travel has been restarted
many of these have started to recruit members across the Coalition and beyond.

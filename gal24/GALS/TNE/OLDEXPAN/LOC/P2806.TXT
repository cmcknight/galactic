Previously a High Stellar balkanised world, it was unified after many years 
of fighting by a Warlord who set up a World Council. This Warlord, Gerraint 
Denran, took a less interventionist role as the years went by, and 
eventually had himself proclaimed Monarch of Dycarl. The Bureaucracy was 
left to rule Dycarl for it's people, with the Monarch only intervening in
occasional matters. A corruption scandal in 1178 led to the new Monarch, 
Jereela Denran, setting up an independent overview agency, and since then
things have been running more-or-less smoothly. The offer to join the VTA 
was embraced with vigour, and currently it's TL is expected to reach 9 in 
1202. Voskl has also provided the technical expertise to reactivate 
Dycarl's Starships, and it is the only other system in the VTA to have a 
Jump-capable Space Force.

The ships of the Royal Space Navy are 2 Shukugan SDBs, 1 Fiery Close 
Escort, 2 armed Beowulf Free Traders, 1 armed Petty Subsidised Merchant and 
1 armed Far Trader.

The Air Force controls two relic Deep Mount Meson Guns, which ensure the 
safety of the planet more than the Space Navy, which wishes to gain control 
of them.

Dycarl's merchant fleet is slightly smaller in comparison to Voskls, but for
 a world it's size is very respectable.

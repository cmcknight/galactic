This world was an important producer of merchant vessels before the 
collapse, but it was hit hard by a Solomani strike during the Black War, 
destroying the starport and it's surrounds. The VTA has attempted to 
recover jump drive production machinery from the world, but has only 
retrieved old field re-alignment equipment. This is currently being 
installed at Dycarl's starport, and will enable it to carry out quicker 
drive maintenance. The planet exports agricultural products, 
pharmaceuticals, and Droyne goods. There are a large amount of Droyne 
Technicians from this world working at the Starport and Scout Base on 
Voskl, where they are performing apparent miracles refurbishing old
starships. The Starport was almost completely built by Voskl.

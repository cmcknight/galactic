
Oriflamme Subsector
-------------------

Oriflamme subsector (renamed from Sarid) has a New Era population of
just over 1.27 billion, a decline of over 10.55 billion from its
pre-Collapse population.  Its highest population is 800 million, at
Oriflamme, and its highest tech level is 9, at Enkidu, Baldur, Zloga,
Oriflamme, and Teldora. Ra experienced its population increase by refugee
immigration during the Collapse period.  Spires was unaffected by the
Collapse. Its low tech native population grew all alone until it was
contacted by the Dawn League. Baldur has been hanging onto survival for 70
years by the skin of its teeth. There are two Cemetery worlds, Enkidu and
Zloga.  Zloga is manned only as a way station between the
spinward-trailing and coreward-rimward halves of the Coalition, but its
population is growing as this traffic increases. Seven other worlds have
actually experienced a population increase over their pre-collapse levels:
Baldur, Lucifer, Shenandoah, Spencer, Nex, Junak, and Teldora.

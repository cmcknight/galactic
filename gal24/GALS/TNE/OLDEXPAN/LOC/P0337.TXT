        The original population of Rohit died off sometime during the 
Collapse. It has been resettled by the Children of Tomorrow, a religious 
group from Lucifer.  The Children follow a strict doctrine, that expouses 
self denial and believes that physical labor is the way to achieve spiritual 
purity.  They felt the lifestyle on Lucifer was incompatiable with their 
goals and decided to emmigrate.  They secured permission to colonize the 
planet  from the Dawn League and began to rebuild the planet's life support 
system.  They have rebuilt a city that is located in an underground cavern 
system. They welcome visitors, but most outsiders find the planet too 
austere.  The Assembly of Worlds allows them to send a non-voting 
represenitive to the  Assembly.  The Children are pressuring to be 
admitted as a full member world.

Old Expanses - Credits
-----------------------

This circa 1200 Old Expanses data, originally created by GDW, was
previously published in the Traveller Navigator software put out
by Planet III (which is currently available as freeware over the
net, see http://www.davtechsys.com/ftp.htm, or if that doesn't
work, see ftp://ftp.davtechsys.com). This data was converted to
Galactic format by Lewis Roberts (lewis@chara.gsu.edu).

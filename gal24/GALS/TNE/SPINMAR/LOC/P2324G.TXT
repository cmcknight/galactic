
  VISITING CAPON

   The first thing a visitor to Capon will notice is the small orbital
   port. Currently being upgraded as part of the Phase 2 Starport
   project, the Up-port is crowded for a class A facility. Once cleared
   by the RQS and Caponese Customs, your ship will land at the First Try
   Memorial Starport. Built on the site of the failed colony, the main
   terminal has an interesting display of artifacts found during the
   port's construction in the late 700s. Ground transport to the capital
   of Burton's Crossing is usually handled by high speed Mag-Lev trains,
   but an option for the traveller with more time is a trip up river on
   one of the many cruise ships.

   Once in Burton's Crossing, (pop: 6.4 million) there are a variety of
   hotels and entertainments. It is important to remember that acts
   perceived as rude will result in a shunning, even from merchants and
   police. Most of the planets economic activity is handled here, rather
   than at the starport, due to the nature of the world's exports. A
   brisk futures market can be found in the Poolside district, and is
   fascinating to watch.

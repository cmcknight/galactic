
Human Religions
---------------   

   In contrast, the local humans - who mainly work in Vargr plantations,
   or in isolated, independent communities - tend toward two religious
   traditions. The larger religion revolves in a form of nature-worship,
   with a stress on the 'interconnectedness' of Menorbianti life, and the
   divinely-ordained place of humans in it. Most of the workers follow
   this faith, and tend to mix wise ecological pratices with the purest
   superstitution (the most prevelant being in the Evil Eye and Forbidden
   Phases). While there is no house of worship or formal prayers, there
   are a LOT of "holy days" and "feast days", which are strongly
   agricultural in nature. There is also the tratidion of the "Holy
   Fool", usually an insane man who supposedly is "closer" to Menorb's
   WorldSpirit than normal mortals.
   
   The isolated "Freeholder" communities - almost all desert tribes -
   prefer their household and tribal idols. Most of these idols are
   weapons of one kind or another - ie. the "Holy Hand Grenade of
   Antioch" or "The First Machinegun of Aezo". Fusion guns are especially
   popular.

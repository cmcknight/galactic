
   Planetary Appearance

   From orbit Hexos appears as a normal world, it is only when seen
   through high resolution imaging devices that one can see the rotting
   corpse of a world that is Hexos. The extremely thin atmosphere does
   not retain much heat, so the average temperature hovers about 100C.
   Most of the water on the planet is located in two large ice caps at
   each pole. Geothermal vents keep small lakes liquid. Primitive lichen
   and algae live around these lakes; so far these are the only native
   forms of life that have been found on the planet.

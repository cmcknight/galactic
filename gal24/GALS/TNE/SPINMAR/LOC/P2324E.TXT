
  SOCIETY

   Caponese society is best characterized as conservative and polite.
   Manners are considered to be of paramount importance in social
   situations. Rudeness will rarely result in violence, but the offender
   will be ignored. Caponese dress in head-to-toe outfits, rarely
   exposing skin to the harmful rays of Cyr. Since UV protection goggles
   are mandatory, it is considered very rude to look an ungoggled person
   in the eyes. Among family and close friends, however, there is no
   nudity taboo. Indeed, communal bathing is part of the Brushlander
   culture.

   There are two distinct sub-cultures on Capon; the majority who live in
   the Lanszeki valley, and the Brushlanders who follow the Basa herds.
   Brushlanders are nomadic, living in massive ATVs. They use kians and
   light grav vehicles to monitor their stock.

   Brushlanders barely acknowledge the existence of the world government,
   preferring their own clan structure. Most Brushlander clans consist of
   several families of 40-60 individuals. Brushlander and mainstream
   Caponese come together annually when the clans bring their herds into
   railheads for auction. At these times, the clan council judges
   disputes between families, allocates goods and profit from the sale,
   and makes arrangements for clan members who wish to leave for any
   reason (usually the clan member is welcome to return at any time).

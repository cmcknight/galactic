
Efate Cities
------------

   Efate cities are very crowded. The Efate are an extremely gregarious
   race, and they love the hustle and bustle of the urban enviroment.
   Their cities aren't very tall, but do spread out over thousands of
   kilometers of area. Clothing tends to imitate the latest Regina
   fashion, and many of the social attitudes are also familiar to
   native-born Reginans. Strangers are enjoyed my most Efate: they are
   easily forgiven of any minor errors, and even if guilty of a grevious
   crime, will only suffer - at worst - expulsion from Efate.
   
   What most stands out on Efate is the vast number of holographic people
   - called "avatars" - which mix and talk with the real Efate. Some of
   these people have been sent by their masters to complete some errand,
   but most of the avatars are of dead Efate, whose personality is
   brought to live by AI programs.
   
     REFEREE: Pre-Virus, the images are projected by small, mobile robot
     spheres which hover over a spot, and project the image downward.
     Now, the cameras and AI computer are mounted on trained TrWanak
     gasbag animals: the AI has no way to communicate to other computers,
     and can only direct the gasbag by mechanical prodding. Also, the AI
     is designed to mechanically fail if infected by Virus.
     
   The Servenai Cults - the premiere Marchman religion, after Imperial
   Catholicism - have many Efate followers, and insists that the souls of
   the dead are only satisified if they're images are permitted to walk
   the land. The Cults - which originated on Capon/2324 (B747748-A) -
   resemble the Roman mystery cults, with ancient Vilani philosophy
   thrown in: currently, 20% of all Marchmen follow it.

   Capon is governed by a Senate that controls appointments to various
   posts. The world is divided into four districts, with Burton's Landing
   constituting a seperate district of its own. Seats are allocated based
   on a districts economic output, resulting in a constant shift in the
   balance of power. The Senators from each district elect one of their
   number to serve on the Executive Council, this body holds the purse
   strings of the Treasury.

   The Senate is popularly elected every five years. Elections are
   staggered, so that any given year 1/5 of the seats are contested.
   Caponese politics are fractious, with several candidates vying for any
   given seat. One wit observed: "Caponese are polite to a fault, and
   that fault is politics."

   Everyday administration is handled by various Ministries. Ministers
   are appointed by the Senate, and nepotism seems to be the rule.
   Lower-level bureaucrats are found through civil service exams, and
   tend to make up for their superiors' failings.

   Law enforcement is under the supervision of the Ministry of Justice
   and the National Police. Laws are mainly intended to preserve order,
   and allow for a wide range of expression. Police tend to be armed with
   non-lethal weapons, and act more as mediators whenever possible. Those
   arrested will be tried before a tribunal consisting of a Senator, a
   police official, and a citizen selected at random. The accused are
   considered innocent until proven guilty. Punishment is slated more
   towards conspicuous public service and embarrassment.

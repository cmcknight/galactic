
Physical Appearance

   Gerome orbits a K2 dwarf in a highly elliptical orbit. The planet also
   has an extreme axial tilt. The eccentricity and the the axial tilt
   causes severe seasonal changes. Temperatures range from 240K to 310K.
   The planet is rugged world wracked by extremely violent storms. These
   storms kick up large amounts of metallic dust. This dust is very
   irritating to humans and other sapiens, requiring the use of filter
   masks. Sapiens who breathe the air without the aid of a filter mask,
   come down with chronic lung infections as the dust particles irritate
   the inner linings of the lungs and throat. This wind borne dust
   constantly erodes man made structures forcing most dwellings below
   ground. Gerome possesses no bodies of water, worthy of being called
   oceans, rather it has many huge lakes.

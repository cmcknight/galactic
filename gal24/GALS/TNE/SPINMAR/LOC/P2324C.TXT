   Capon, viewed from orbit, is an attractive blue-green world. The
   visitor may notice the vast ice fields that cover large areas of the
   land masses. Also of note are the World Spine Mountains, a famed
   destination for sport climbers for centuries.

   Capon has a thin atmosphere, with a almost non-existent ozone layer.
   Caponese life has adapted to the harsh conditions, and the colonists
   all tend to be of a very dark shade. Travellers, however, must take
   precautions against high UV levels. Since much of the valley is
   snow-covered throughout the year, exposed human eyes can suffer
   permanent damge in a matter of minutes due to "snow blindness". Eye
   protection is a must, and either fully covering garments or a strong
   sunblock is needed to avoid a painful melanoma.

   There are two main continents; Nord, which is ice bound, and Pillagi,
   where most settlement has occurred along the Lanzecki river basin. The
   Lanzecki, which flows 12,000km from the World Spine to the Hester
   Ocean, is a meandering, slow river. Its flood plain provides for much
   of the agricultural output of the world.

   Visitors to Emerald are advised to exercise caution when traveling
   outside of the starport compound. Certain conservative elements on the
   planet are currently actively campaigning against offworld contact,
   evoking xenophobic reactions from portions of the population. Although
   Emerald's official policy is still neutral towards visitors,
   travellers can expect problems when dealing with locals, especially
   those from certain reactionary families (chiefly Farsi-Ecannis).
   Reports of atrocities against newly-arrived Zhodani refugees are yet
   to be confirmed.

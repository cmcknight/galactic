
Religion
--------

   While the Servani Cults are the most flamboyant religion on Efate, the
   dominant religion remains Imperial Catholicism. The Deneb Rite remains
   the most influential with over half the population's alligence, but
   Sylean, American, and Vilani Rites are also common.
   
   The population is quite pious, and place strong emphasis on the
   graciousness of the Lord. Assorted religious meetings - from major
   religious festivals to spontaneous 'street dancing' - are quite
   common. While Efate does not have the most awe-inspiring cathedrals or
   the most learned and wise of churchmen, they do embrace their faith
   with vigour and joy. Which is somewhat ironic: about 2/3rds of Regency
   Christians believe that nonhumans shouldn't be allowed to join the
   church, either because they lack the "imageo dei" (the Image of God),
   or because they feel that Christianity is about God speaking to men,
   and that God would use other native religions to speak to nonhumans,
   not Christianity.
   
   The tendency of Efate Catholics to stress the power of the Holy Spirit
   - and to utterly ignore the commandments and laws of God - tends to
   aggravate most Catholic churchmen. Never mind the problem of whether
   Jesus died for nonhuman sinners or not, or if this theology even makes
   sense when applied to aliens. Or even if Efate are 'sinners' in any
   meaningful sense: how can they transgress a law that they never
   received?
   
   Note: Efate was a major beneficiary of the Regency Industrial
   Development Program.

First Impressions

The streets of Tavonni are very cosmopolitan. Droyne (a few) rub
shoulders (or shoulder to hip) with Aslan (a large portion of
the population). Many businesses have been started with
multi-racial, and multi-species partners. Most such businesses
find the diversity an encouragement for all their client races.
Travellers find the population open and friendly. Since most
people are only first- or second-generation settlers (sometimes
third), they welcome people from across the Regency.

The Military

Since the very start of development on Tavonni, there has always
had a strong military presence in the system. Starting by
settling the Ftai company, Tavonni has constantly reviewed and
upgraded its defences. The Sword World border was always on the
mind of Count Leto, and he was the first to recommend annexation
of the Sword Worlds when they began their land grab.

The need for the military has never been questioned - especially
in light of the fact that they are citizens with voting rights.
The Tavonni Planetary Navy and the Ashsiimkir-Ftai regiment
cemented this need in the hearts of the populace, with their
heroic defence of the system against the invading Sword World
fleets.

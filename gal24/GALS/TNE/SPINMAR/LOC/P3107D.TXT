
  ORBITAL MOTION

   Lewis orbits the gas giant Zenthra in just over seven standard days.
   It is tidally locked with Zenthra. So one side always faces the
   planet. Since Zenthra is so big in the sky, (3.75 degrees, over seven
   times the angular size of Luna), it eclipses the sun each once each
   time Lewis orbits it. The eclipse lasts about two hours. Inselberg
   is situated in a prime viewing site for this, and most visitors view
   the eclipse several times.


Governor Justin Muurgan:
  
Governor Muurgan is 105 years old.  Even though he is ancient,
his body is in rather good condition.  He prides himself on walking 
two miles everyday.  He does this even when travelling on a
starship.  This often annoys the crew, as he tends to like to
stroll around engineering bays.  He has a closely cropped  
thinning white hair, and a very dark complexion.

The Governor is often travelling to meet with supporters, or to
gather more supporters.  He meets with small groups of people,
here and there.  He only addresses large crowds, on those worlds
where  the  cause  of Lewis is a popular one.  On these worlds he
often attends fundraisers, and other gala events.  He is often
invited to parties where he is a minor celebrity.

The Governor is driven by the idea of freedom for his people.
He will do almost anything to get them free. He realizes that
most of the people who invite him to parties, or come to his
speeches, are more interested in his celebrity than his cause.
But if they donate money, they help the cause, even if they
don't believe in it as much as he does.

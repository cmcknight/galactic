
Landholdings
------------

Originally, the estate of the Count of Tavonni consisted of the
entire system of Tavonni. This expanse of territory has dwindled
somewhat, due to the constitutional laws agreed to by the Count.

Crown Land is land directly owned by the Count's Household. This
is also known collectively as the County Estate. Private
citizens or companies may purchase freehold real estate from the
County Estate. This is then considered to be "private land". The
Government of Tavonni is granted land for public use ("public
land") by the County Estate. Public land also includes other
areas of Crown Land specifically set aside by the Count. The
Government may resume private land, but only by Statute.

Resources beneath the land are NOT the possession of the owner;
these are possessed by the lessee of the mineral rights for the
area. If there is no stated lessee, then the implied ownership
rests with the Count of Tavonni.

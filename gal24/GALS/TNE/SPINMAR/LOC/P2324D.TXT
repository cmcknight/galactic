
  HISTORY

   Capon was settled in 124, with colonists drawn from the Deneb sector.
   The first colony failed within 50 years due to poor planning. In 180,
   an Imperial Navy base was started on the site of the first colony.
   Ministry of Colonization officials scoured the area for colonists who
   could stand the extreme UV levels. The result was one of the oddest
   collections of people ever to settle a world. While regulations were
   followed in skills available and male-female ratios, etc.; most of the
   colonists had never met each other until they were on the transports.
   The second colony was established in the Lanzecki River's broad delta
   region. After clearing the heavy jungle, the region was found to be
   very fertile, supporting a wide variety of crops along with
   aquaculture.

   The Second Frontier War saw the invasion of Capon by Sword Worlds
   forces. An attempt to deny the Naval Base to the Imperium, the
   occupation led to a bitter guerilla war that last three years
   (617-620). The Occupation, as it is remembered, has left a lasting
   dislike of off-worlders in general and Sword Worlders in particular.


St. George (2616) was not colonized until 360, when technology to overcome
its atmosphere was developed. Much of the system's population lived in
orbital complexes, safe from the effects of the atmosphere. The kesternet
plant, which grows only on St. George, is an important ingredient of
anagathic drugs. The Collapse coupled with civil unrest on the planet
resulted in the deaths of most of its population as Virus took over the
orbital habitats' computers and sent them plummetting into the insidious
atmosphere below.

The dominant native animal of St. George is, of course, a "dragon."
Lizard-like in appearance, but bearing live young, these feisty animals
spit a fluid that catches fire in the hydrogen atmosphere. The resemblance
was too good to pass up for the original colonists.


The Nulisud (1937) atmosphere's high concentration of oxygen has
traditionally prevented efficient settlement of the low-lying regions.
Before the Collapse, Nulisud was a trade center and the subsector capital.
It featured one of the best starports in its area of space. Agents of the
Istuary Concordat managed to salvage the starport before Virus was able to
decimate it.

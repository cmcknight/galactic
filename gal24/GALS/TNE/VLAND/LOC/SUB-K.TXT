Subsector Notes

This subsector was horribly devastated by Virus during the early days of
the Collapse. Containing many high-population worlds along the rimward edge
of the Vilani Main, Kasear Subsector was completely unprepared for the
onslaught of Virus and victimized by some of the largest hordes of the
early Doomslayer strains. It is unlikely that the subsector will ever fully
recover from the destruction.


Khula (1919), when first explored by a Vilani sublight colonial expedition
to -9310, was determined to have been the site of a human civilization
which had died out several thousand years before. This was the first time
the Vilani found evidence of another human race. Native Khulans in the New
Era maintain a small fleet of starships utilized primarily for defense of
their system and trade with neighboring Vland.

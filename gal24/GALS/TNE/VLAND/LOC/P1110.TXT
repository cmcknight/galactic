
In the pre-Collapse era, an automated refuelling station serves travellers
at Liwar (1110) in an otherwise useless system. The machines of the system
were serviced by a hermit, who avoided any contact with outsiders. Most
vessels would stay at the refueling station no longer than necessary.
Vampire fleets made frequent stops at Liwar in the early days of Virus. The
resources of the base were eventually depleted and as far as anyone knows,
the station remains a desolate, unvisited hulk for some six decades now.

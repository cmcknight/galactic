
Newcastle (1801) was invaded in 1104 by a band of Vargr corsairs serving
the Church of the Chosen Ones. The Vargr easily overwhelmed the system's
low-tech defenses, and took over the system mainworld. The pirates stripped
the system of many of its resources before eventually dusting off and
heading for parts unknown. The power vaccuum was immediately filled by
Vargr of the Ngath Confederation who raided shipping from a clandestine
base in the system's Oort cloud in an unusual concentration of dark-ice
asteroids. When Virus struck, the Ngath cautiously observed the carnage
from afar, sending intermittent scouts to provide reconnaissance. One of
the scouts was inadvertantly infected by Virus and brought it to the
corsair base. Fortunately for the Ngath, they were able to firewall their
systems before too much damage was done. After the initial onslaught of
Virus, the Ngath moved in and usurped the exhausted Newcastilian government
and made the system a mecca for coreward refugee Vargr. While the marriage
of human and Vargr cultures has not been an easy one, Newcastle's very
survival may have depended on the late arrival of the reluctant Ngath
rescuers. The united human-Vargr Newcastilian government has created a
low-tech, but sound system defense and made minor inroads into restoring
interstellar trade in the region.

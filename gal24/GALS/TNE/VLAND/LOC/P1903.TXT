
Gemid (1903) was famous for its high-tech weaponry, especially neurotoxins.
When Virus struck, the system was stripped of most of its industrial
resources and most of the native inhabitants were killed using their own
technology. It is thought that the Gemidi weaponry was used by units of
Virus-infected robots to murder the populations of several neighboring
systems. Ngath corsairs managed to requisition several dozen TL-16 laser
and particle accelerator weapons, a fact that contributed to their ability
to fend off Virus at Newcastle system. Years of neglect and the inability
to properly maintain the weapons, however, has resulted in their gradual
decline in effectiveness.

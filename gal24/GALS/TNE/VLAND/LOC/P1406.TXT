
Timat (1406) has independently achieved interstellar flight. Largely left
alone by the initial onslaught of Virus, the residents of Timat have
gradually built their industrial base. They have successfully refurbished
six free traders and three subsidized merchants, arming and equipping them
by cannibalizing starships that were either stranded on Timat during the
Collapse or crash-landed there in subsequent years. The trader fleet would
actually be larger, but on two occasions refurbished starships were
accidentally equipped with Virus-infected salvaged parts. The ships were
immediately reinfected by Virus once they were made operational and
proceeded to attack the Timati. Fortunately, the Timati were defended
successfully by other ships in their trader fleet. The trader fleet has
reestablished trade ties with Diiron and Maran and provides freight service
and trade interface between the two worlds and Timat itself. In 1188, a
small Vampire Fleet invaded the system, much to the consternation of its
inhabitants. In a stroke of diplomatic genius, Timat's leaders managed to
strike a deal with the benign Hobbyist/Empire Builder-strain Vampire ships
to avoid a confrontation. Timat's leaders fear the day when a more
belligerant Virus enters their system.

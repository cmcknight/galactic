
Tauri (1817), a mere 2.17 light-years from Vland, was the first system
visited by the old Vilani sublight ships nearly 10,000 years ago. Although
originally colonized as a research station, its population had grown to
extremes over the millennia, but were vastly depleted during the Collapse.

Because of its strategic position as the first world on the Vilani Main,
its economy was supported mainly by banking and commerce flowing through
its port, rather than by onworld industries. Following the Collapse, many
Taurians escaped to Vland before the planet's life support systems were
either commandeered by Virus or failed of their own volition.

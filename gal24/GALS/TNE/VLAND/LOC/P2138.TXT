
Istuary (2138) weathered the Collapse quite well, relatively speaking. The
Droyne of the world united with the human population to provide civil
defense during the worst of the Vampire Fleet attacks and then enacted a
proactive reconstruction program using Project Jumpstart caches. The humans
of the world engage in a human variant of the coyn ceremony and exhibit the
first known example of a human-Droyne hybrid culture. The Istuary Concordat
is the fledgling interstellar government based on this world. Many
inhabitants of Istuary are migrants from the neighboring wilds, transported
by the Istuarians to provide much-needed labor for their ambitious
reconstruction programs.

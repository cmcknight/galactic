
Isle (1038) has literally become a solitary isle of technology in an
otherwise devastated subsector. Because of its comparatively low technology
level, Isle was somewhat more difficult to digest by Virus. Isle's small
fleet of armed transports and freighters are used primarily to travel to
neighboring systems, raid them of much needed resources and then return to
their waterlogged homeworld.

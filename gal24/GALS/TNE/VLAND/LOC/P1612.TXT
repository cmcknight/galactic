
Ersii (1612) has three of the richest asteroid belts in the entire Vland
sector. The Khuushe family of the Imperial Nobility owned and ruled the
system before the Collapse.

After the chaos of Virus hit, however, the crime syndicate that had
controlled the system's ore processing facilities, managed to divert the
first wave of Vampire Fleets against the Khuushe, who were subsequently
destroyed. The ancestors of the syndicate have managed to maintain control
of the system in the intervening decades by making deals with the Vampire
Fleets that frequent the system.

The syndicate's current Jefi provides human labor for the Vampire Fleets in
return for autonomy over the system and a "hands-off" policy toward his
small but well-armed starship fleet.

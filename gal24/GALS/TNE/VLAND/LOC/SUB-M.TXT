Subsector Notes

This subsector's remarkably high survival rate was due to advance warning
of Virus by fast couriers of the 54th Fleet and the rapid dispersal of
Answerin warriors to most worlds and starship squadrons of the subsector.
Advance word of Virus and techniques to fight it had crossed Vland in time
for the worlds of the subsector to quickly unite and provide a defensive
front against the initial onslaught. Though billions of lives were lost,
some semblance of civilization has been maintained on many of the worlds in
the subsector. Though the populations of these worlds have suffered in
subsequent attacks, and any remnant of interstellar trade has been stamped
out, the populations of these worlds remain hopeful of one day acquiring
outside help to pull themselves up from the ashes.

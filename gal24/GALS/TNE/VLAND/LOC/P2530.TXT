
Thaggesh (2530) survived in no small part due to the fact that the 241st
Fleet was present insystem during the Collapse. About a third of the ships
managed to avoid viral contamination and valiantly succeeded in destroying
the rest of the fleet. The few surviving ships served as system defense
against Virus for awhile, but have been completely depleted since then. The
system maintains only a few squadrons of SDBs for its defense today. In
addition to the aid of the fleet, Thaggesh survived due to the unique use
of technology by its inhabitants. Technology is primarily controlled by a
priest/technologist class, who maintain strict guidelines on the use of any
and all advanced technology on the planet. Refer to the Thaggeshi section
for additional information. Thaggesh stands as a remote bastion of human
civilization amid the ruins of the wilds.


Shabii (2408) was a warehouse planet for Makhidkarun. The planet's
mechanized storage units and landing areas for transport covered much of
the surface. A God-Strain Virus infected the planet's central data core,
and subsequently conquered the entire planet's data network. The Virus
entity now provides spare parts and mechanized labor to Vampire Fleet ships
for a price, usually human or robotic labor. Though it maintains a squadron
of jump-capable starships, which it has used to raid neighboring systems of
additional parts and equipment, the Virus is slowly running out of
equipment and may soon abandon the complex.

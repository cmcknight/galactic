
Pirrom (0530) is the site of a former Vilani naval base. Refugees from
neighboring rift worlds fled to Pirrom for protection during the early days
of the Collapse. The logistics of admitting refugees to their world and the
subsequent concentration on defense against Virus resulted in the
dissolution of the naval base. The naval personnel and their descendants
have successfully staved off Virus for over 70 years with two
Lightning-class cruisers that were stationed at the base before the
Collapse. The refugees that fled the Virus wave warned the Pirroman naval
personnel in time for them to make adequate preparations to protect their
ships' computer systems. Advanced preparation and the benefits of
astrography have made Pirrom a defensible system. Nevertheless, the damage
sustained by the cruisers and system SDB fleet has been great after so many
years of fighting. Fortunately, the Virus attacks have declined in the past
decade or so as the Vampire Fleets have begun to cling more to the Vampire
Highway.

Since 1192, Pirrom has made inroads with neighboring Khulekii and Answerin
systems. In exchange for technical assistance, the Answerin have staffed
the Pirroman ships with Answerin marines, some of the most feared fighting
forces in known space during the Rebellion.

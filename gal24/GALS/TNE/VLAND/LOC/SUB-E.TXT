Subsector Notes

Lying on the trailing edge of the Great Rift, Lalaki Khirir was spared the
worst effects of Virus. Vampire Fleets appeared on the scene in the
subsector relatively late. By that time, the loss of interstellar trade and
resupply of much-needed resources resulted in mass immigration to the
Domain of Deneb for those refugees who could make it out in time, and death
for those who could not.

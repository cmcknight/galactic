
Irila (2211) a former Imperial park planet, is the site of beautiful
natural scenery and animal life totally unafraid of humans. A First
Imperium conservation society had bought it outright. The charter passed
into Sharurshid's hands unchanged. Although operated for a profit, it was
maintained as naturally as possible. During the early Virus years, several
starships of the Restored Ziru Sirkaa that were infected with
Doomslayer-strain Viruses, intentionally crashed themselves into Irila's
surface. While some contamination of the planet's atmosphere occurred, its
ecosystem remains, for the most part, intact.


Wimorel (3129) features an Ancient Site that has only a few ruins
attributable to the Ancients, but it has a great many ruins of a stone age
culture that apparently coexisted with the Ancients, under their
protection, and shared their fate in the Final War. The current inhabitants
descended from animals that were near intelligence when the other two races
were wiped out. Their numbers are rather small, but the Kolzair are
inventive and determined. They are roughly humanoid, but have scaly skins
and a low body temperature. The Kolzair are now the solitary sentient
inhabitants of the planet.

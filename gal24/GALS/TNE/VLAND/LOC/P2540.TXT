
Kalaalit (2540) was a Vampire slave state, utilized by several Vampire
Fleets as a manufacturing center for spare parts, until Istuary Concordat
troops landed there and liberated the world. Kalaalit is now a client state
of the Istuary Concordat. Typical Virus fractiousness has dissipated any
attempt at retaliation.

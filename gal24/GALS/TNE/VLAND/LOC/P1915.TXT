
Giinam (1915) was a hunting preserve maintained only for Imperial nobles
before the Collapse. Is is a well-known fact that a fortune in heavy metals
is among the system mainworld's resources, but the ruling nobility refused
to allow exploitation in the pre-Collapse era since it would have ruined
the hunting. Because of its resources, Giinam is a coveted world by
colonists from the Regency who are seeking to stake claims. This small
planet has a standard atmosphere, because of its high density.

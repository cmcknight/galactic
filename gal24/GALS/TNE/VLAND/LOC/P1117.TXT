
The Uris Belt (1117) was the site of a Naval Construction Yard specializing
in large ships fashioned from the belt's planetoids. When the Virus hit,
Uris Belt's shipyards were the first targets of destruction by the
self-hating Doomslayer-strain viruses. Most, if not all, of the ships built
at Uris were infected and destroyed in the early days of the Collapse.

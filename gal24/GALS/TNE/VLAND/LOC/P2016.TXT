
Zurrian (2016) was famous for its shurshi cloth. This delicate, iridescent
material is strong for its weight, and a shurshi garment retains its beauty
for many years. The cleaned cloth was shipped all over the sector, and
beyond - for those who could afford it. The local aristocracy claimed 10%
of the harvest, but otherwise left the populace to its own devices. This
fantastically expensive substance is produced by a local insect which has
been altered and conditioned to spin its webbing in sheets. The natives
keep hives of them as other humans keeps bees, and harvest the cloth
periodically. Attempts to raise these insects elsewhere have failed.
Shurshi continues to be utilized as barter in the system's markets. Because
the planet's high-tech means of manufacture have been depleted, the
substance is now more rare than ever.

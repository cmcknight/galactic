
Colonized during the First Imperium with a dome ecology, Sikilar (1107) was
a popular retirement world, because of its low gravity. As the Long Night
deepened, it was cut off completely from interstellar contact. Technology
became the province of a social class. The domes were maintained by rote
knowledge, but their atmosphere became thinner over the centuries. The
population physically adapted to this change.

Then an ambitious adventurer by the name of Dhusa (the only name now
remembered) arrived from a higher tech world awed the populace with his
"magic," and set up a religious dictatorship. Dhusa's legacy was one of the
most draconian governments ever to blight the face of the Imperium. This
highly insular, xenophobic culture died out during the early months of the
Collapse.

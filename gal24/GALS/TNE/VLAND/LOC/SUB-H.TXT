Subsector Notes

This subsector was renamed Arshukaa Sagalaa by the government of the
Restored Ziru Sirkaa. Since the Collapse, no power to speak of has risen to
fill the void left when Shiigus was annihilated by Virus-infected
starships. Since Shiigus Subsector contained the highest density of systems
along the Vilani Main, Vland chose the name Arshukaa Sagalaa, Vilani for
"Vilani Main."

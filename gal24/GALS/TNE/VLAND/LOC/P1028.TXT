
Apurshish (1028) has recently managed to repair and field a squadron of
starships. The planet was spared the devastation that other worlds suffered
during the Collapse due to its comparatively low tech level. Virus was not
able to effectively invade Apurshishi computer systems to wreak havoc on
the planet's population. Refugees from neighboring higher tech systems have
created an influx of technical knowledge that has resulted in the formation
of a progressive planetary government. The Apurshishi fleet, a squadron of
jump-1 refurbished close escorts, free traders and patrol cruisers, has
begun to engage in trade with neighboring worlds.

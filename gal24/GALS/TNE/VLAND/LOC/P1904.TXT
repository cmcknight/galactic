
Daama (1904) was at one time a smuggler's paradise. Its non-aligned status
kept it free from Imperial restrictions, and its close proximity to Gemid
supplied it with a variety of black market goods. Daamans, in an effort to
make their world less delectable to roaming Vampire Fleets, methodically
destroyed all items of high technology. While the system's gas giant
remains a frequent stopover for Vampire ships, the mainworld is generally
left alone.

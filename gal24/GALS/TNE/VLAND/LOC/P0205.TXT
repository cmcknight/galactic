
When the wind blows on Khankari (0205) you notice. The dense atmosphere
carries enormous kinetic energy, and distributes heat from the tropics to
the poles. Khankari's sharp axial tilt and short year (in the inner orbit
around a cool star) contribute to abrupt seasonal changes and generate some
of the sector's most dramatic weather. Hurricanes wiped out the first
colony planted here, and then decimated the population repeatedly
thereafter. The small group now living here uses well-reinforced homes,
often underground. Ironically, Khankari's adverse turbulence is the very
thing that protected it from invading Vampire Fleets, who found the
planet's tumultuous environment much too dangerous to navigate.


Before the Collapse, mercenaries from Answerin (0431) commanded premium
prices for service. Answerin culture holds fear of any kind to be a disease
of the mind, and its psychiatrists have succeeded in eradicating all
anxiety from the populace. The principal diagnostic tool for this is a
portable device which detects anxiety by analyzing brain waves and
autonomic physiological responses. The device bordered too closely on
psionic practices for legal export to the rest of the Imperium, but illegal
copies were sometimes smuggled out.

An alliance with neighboring Pirrom has enabled them to make great strides
in the effort to recover from the Collapse. The Pirromans have enabled them
to refit some of their dilapidated starships with TL-9 hardware, but except
for a very few ships, most do not have jump capability.

Vland Sector - Credits
----------------------

The Classic/MegaTraveller version of the Vland Sector was
covered to some extent in issue 5 of The Travellers' Digest
put out by Digest Group Publications in 1986. The people
involved in the Vland write-up from that issue were Nancy
Parker and J. Andrew Keith.

This sector was later updated by GDW in the Regency Sourcebook.
Additional work is by Chris Griffen.


SINDAL

The Sindal subsector is defended by the 203rd Fleet, headquartered at Albe
(2211). The Sindal frontier is part of RQD 6, shared by Pax Rulin
subsector.

The General Development Company (GeDCo) was active in Trojan Reach and Reft
and dates to the early 600s when Empress Arbellatra resettled many nobles
in the Imperium's border regions. As these regions were undeveloped, many
of these nobles pooled their wealth for the establishment of an
organization dedicated to trade and increase of technology levels. The
result was GeDCo which achieved success through trade and the production of
high-tech export goods.

When the Regency government established its Industrial Development Program
it borrowed heavily from the expertise and structure of GeDCo. Many GeDCo
executives became Regency officials, and portions of the GeDCo
infrastructure were taken over whole by the Regency government and became
local offices of the Industrial Development administration.

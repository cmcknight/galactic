
Goria (1410), a world of rather limited resources, fostered an active
pirate community before the arrival of the Aslan Ihatei invaders. The world
was deemed of only moderate value to the Aslan, but significant enough for
colonization and possessing of a considerable amount of open land. After
the Aslan took control, the wily and warlike Gorians took to the outback
and have conducted guerilla warfare with the Aslan intermittently. The
small Aslan garrison on the planet seems content to engage in occasional
shootouts with the tenacious Gorians and have yet to ask for assistance
from local clans to finally extinguish this nuisance.

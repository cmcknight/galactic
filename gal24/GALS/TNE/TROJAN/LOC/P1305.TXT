
Gollere (1305) was a relatively peaceable world, slowly reaching out to the
stars with innovative technological development programs when the world was
stricken by famine in 1128. It is suspected that Aslan insurgents may have
introduced a biological element into the Gollerian atmosphere in an attempt
to flush out the human inhabitants of the world, much as they did on Hexos
(Spinward Marches: 2828). The Gollerians survived the famine, but soon
became embroiled in several brushfire wars over the remaining scarce
resources of the planet. Fortunately, Regency military forces stepped in in
1133 to help stabilize the political situation on the planet. While it was
the ultimate goal of the Regency peacekeeping forces to return the world to
civilian government after the crisis ended, the Gollerian military junta
became entrenched and refused to give up their political role. While the
result has been a relatively peaceable arrangement, the Regency is closely
watching this world to ensure that human rights abuses do not develop.

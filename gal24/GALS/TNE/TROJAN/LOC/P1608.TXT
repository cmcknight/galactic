
Braudel (1608) was home to a primitive nomadic people whose outstanding
characteristic was an inherited animal telempathy talent which enabled them
to control the world's most prominent herd animal, the yurfel. The IISS had
long ago interdicted this world in an effort to leave this culture alone.
The Aslan have honored this human edict and generally leave the Braudeli to
their own devices, being cautious to exploit resources far from the
Braudeli and their herds.

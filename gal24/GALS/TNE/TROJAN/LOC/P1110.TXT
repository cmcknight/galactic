
The inhabitants of Velscur (1110) are comprised of several tribes, the
largest of which lives in the ruins of a First-Imperium era Vilani starport
facility. While the Velscuri have built their own buildings atop the ruins,
the artistically impressive remnants of the starport, theorized by
archaeologists to have been a TL-9 C-class facility, are clearly present
throughout the town. It appears the architect of the ruins had a love of
ancient Vilani mythology. Many of Vland's heroes and demigods are
immortalized in stone among the edifices still standing. The citizens of
the ruins-dwelling tribes worship the gods and heroes, of whom they have
constructed their own pantheon of deities.

Velscur managed to avoid falling under the dominion of the raiding Aslan by
the virtue of the local plantlife. Spores produced by local fungi contain
enzymes that produce extreme allergic reactions in many Aslan. Rather than
razing the Velscuri earth wherever the spores lived, the Aslan chose to
leave this small and rather insignificant world alone.

Sporadic contact with Regency traders over the last 70 years has enabled
the Velscuri to raise their tech level by a modest amount.

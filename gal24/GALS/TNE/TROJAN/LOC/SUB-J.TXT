
GOERTEL

An Aslan separatist state known as The Glorious Empire was once centered in
this subsector. The Empire, formed by the Tokouea'we clan in 650, expanded
militarily. By the 900s, a lack of resources forced expansion to a halt,
but by then the Empire had grown to embrace 13 worlds.

Although dominated by Aslan, about one third of the Empire's population was
human. Humans provided cheap labor, while the Aslan enjoyed government and
professional positions. Outsiders found the Empire's society more
oppressive than glorious - a state run through forced subservience and
aggression.

The Empire was reabsorbed into the Hierate's trans-Rift colonies in 1119.

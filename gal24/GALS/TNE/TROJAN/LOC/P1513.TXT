
Tlazolteotl (1513) is an island of human society in Aslan-occupied
territory. During the Ihatei invasions, this world was thought to be a
world of marginal value, worth conquering after more suitable worlds had
been taken in the surrounding area. With advance word of the Aslan plan,
the Tlazolteotlians dug in, building impressive civil defense facilities to
protect the population. When the Aslans invaded, they were repelled at
every turn by the comparatively primitive Tlazolteotlians, who were so
well-entrenched that the Aslans could not establish any permanent
footholds. Rumor has it the Aslans were prepared to use nuclear and
biological weapons to break the will of the feisty Tlazolteotlians when the
Regency Accords were just being drafted. The timely signing of the accords
proved to be a reprieve for the weary Tlazolteotlians.


Fist (2918) is the location of bitter Aslan-human fighting. The world's
government, fearful of Aslan power, concluded deals for Aslan settlement.
When the disgusted populace overthrew the government and demanded that the
Aslan depart, the Aslan refused; they had gotten their land fair and
square. Naturally, war resulted.

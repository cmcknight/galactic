
Pa'an (0909) is the site of a far-flung Zhodani colony. At one time
governed by a feudalistic oligarchy of psionic nobles, increased
colonization of the world by Zhodani settlers over the last century has
brought modernization and more pluralistic government to the world. The
xenophobia that marked the Pa'anese culture of the past is no longer
evident. Patrol vessels and Zhodani traders from Cronor, Shiadlia and
Jewell subsectors in the Spinward Marches frequently travel the trade
routes to this world to conduct commerce with their displaced brothers.

buying out the agricultural world's failing meat-packing industry.

but the humans of this world (which was suffering disastrous unemployment
because of the Imperial withdrawal from the subsector) opposed what
appeared to be an Aslan economic takeover and rebelled. Wars are easier to
start than they are to end.

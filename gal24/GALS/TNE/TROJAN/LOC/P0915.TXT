
While most of the worlds in Dpres Subsector were lost to the Aslan during
the Ihatei invasions, a few have maintained their independence. Solaria
(0914) and Dpres (0915) are two such examples. They have sustained their
independence by maintaining a staunch mutual defense pact and allying
themselves with the Florians. The Florians have been allowed to establish
a permanent naval presence in Dpres system in return for their protection.
The Dpresians benefit from this agreement in more ways than one. The
infusion of advanced Florian technology at the naval base has provided
incidental assistance to Dpresian industry. In addition, both Dpres and
Solaria benefit from their trade ties with the Florians.


Senlis (2108) was the capital of a small interstellar union called the
Senlis Foederate before the Aslan Ihatei usurped the system. The union was
primarily a small defense and trading alliance encompassing three worlds
including Senlis, Orsasch (2008) and Magen (2309). It benefitted from being
the first stage of the jump-4 route across Trojan Reach to the Aslan
colonies. This benefit quickly became a liability when millions of Aslan
started pouring across the rift, quickly converting Senlis into one of many
Ihatei jumping-off points.

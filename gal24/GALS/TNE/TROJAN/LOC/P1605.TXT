
Vior (1605) was inhabited by primitive troglodytic cannibals prior to the
Collapse. Living beneath the airless world's surface in the ruins of an
ancient subterranean facility, the Viorans were notorious for capturing
visiting free trader crews and making a quick meal of them. The Viorans
were all too eager to add the Aslan to their diets when the Ihatei came
calling. A clever Aslan military officer quickly determined the nature of
Vioran society and after performing a perfunctory evaluation of the world,
had the Viorans systemically killed. He then had his troops dust off in
their transports and the world has never been set foot on since.

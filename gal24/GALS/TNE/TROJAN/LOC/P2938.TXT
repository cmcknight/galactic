
Sarage (2938) was the site of an Imperial client state and research station
before the Collapse. While the system was cut off from the Domain of Deneb,
it has maintained its independent navy by virtue of long-haul maintenance
runs from ships in Tobia subsector and its own self-sufficient research
community. The primary focus of the research facility is to study the
Droyne culture on Auitawry. The Regency, believing Auitawry to be a crucial
strategic world, however, has continued to fund Sarage's diplomatic and
research efforts despite its non-aligned status.


Gorgon (1005) was at one time an exile planet for the Belgardian Sojourn, a
deceased interstellar government at one time headquartered at Belgard
(0305). Life for Gorgon's inmates was extremely harsh because the world's
surface is exposed to constant high-velocity winds. In some areas the
vegetation has adapted by growing in umbrellate forms to an average height
of two meters. A micro-climate was fostered underneath this layer of
vegetation in which the prisoners lived their dismal lives.

The first waves of Aslan Ihatei to sweep into the system quickly discovered
the planet's large untouched deposits of rare earths and the valuable
parasol trees whose limbs and trunks are comprised of some of the hardest
natural substances known. The Hlearkhea clan of Afawahisa sector laid claim
to the world and quickly consumed the planet's vast regions of untouched
land. While the conditions on the world are harsh, the Aslan seem content
with the huge expanses of land and the valuable organic commodities the
world provides.


Auitawry (3140), is considered a likely candidate for the homeworld of
Yaskoydray, the legendary leader of the Ancients. The civilization on
Auitawry is the most advanced post-Collapse Droyne culture. The world was
interdicted by the Imperium in pre-Rebellion times and the only outside
contact with the world in the last 200 years has been from neighboring
Sarage.

Pre-Collapse archaeological findings at Ancients sites around the Imperium
began to show indications that a second advanced civilization might have
existed along with the Ancients. Auitawry is believed to be a possible link
in this mystery.

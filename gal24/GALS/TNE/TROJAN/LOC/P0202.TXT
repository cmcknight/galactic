
Sam's World (0202) has recently been under examination by the RISS for a
potential Regency membership offering. The Samuelians' primary industry is
the processing of ores and radioactives mined from the rich and untapped
belts of Sable des Etos. The Samuleans, largely cut off from interstellar
society, have been subjected to extreme levels of propaganda by the Sablean
industrialists. The oppresive Sableans, who do not want their industrial
output altered in the least, are "protecting their investment" in Sam's
World by feeding the flames of their xenophobia. The RISS is in a quandary
as to how to reeducate the Samueleans without perturbing Sable des Etos, a
vital rimward industrial ally to the Regency.

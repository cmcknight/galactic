
In contrast to the experience of other Aslan-visited worlds, Imisaa (2916)
benefitted from non-violent and helpful Aslan investment. With the local
economic downturn during the Civil War, the Imisaan economy was saved by
Aslan investment, as Aslan traders were well-known on this world. In return
for this investment the Aslan were granted unused land to settle in the
Imissan outback. Given the character of Imisaan land (it is coded a desert
world), the human inhabitants felt fortunate indeed that someone would pay
them for this useless real estate. The world's population is now 89% Aslan.

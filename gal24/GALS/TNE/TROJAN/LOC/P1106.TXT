
Belgard (1106) was at one time the capital of a small interstellar
community called the Belgard Sojourn. Limited to a precious few poorly
maintained starfaring craft, the TL-9 Soujourn would have been more
accurately rated at TL 6 for the most part. The origin of this tiny
starfaring community was lost in the sands of time, but it is suspected
that the name is a corruption of Beauregard, the name of a former Imperial
navy commander who fled to the region after he fell from grace in the naval
ranks.

Belgard's natural resources have been ravaged by its inhabitants. While
their blatant disregard for the planet is evident, it seems that their
culture had never viewed Belgard as more than a transitory home. The
primary products of the planet were animal pelts, gems and zuchai crystals,
the latter being the valuable commodity that attracted the Hlearkhea clan
to the conquest of the world in 1119. The invading Aslans allowed the
meager human population of the planet to remain, but they imposed strict
laws which severely limit the Belgardians freedom to conduct trade and
continue their exploitation of the planet's resources. In fact, the human
Belgardians are really little more than slave labor at this point.

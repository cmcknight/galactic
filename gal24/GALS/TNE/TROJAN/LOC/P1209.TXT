
Waorl (1209) is the site of yet another lost Vilani colony. Artifacts
salvaged from the ruins indicate that the inhabitants of the world probably
had independently achieved tech level 10. The planet's former B-class
starport, manufacturing centers and mining sites all exhibit high levels of
radiation, apparently from nuclear weapons. In addition, several defunct
satellites and impact craters left by fallen satellites indicate that
following the war, the system was left to decay. It is believed that this
world may have been the first to fall during a 50-year period of nuclear
and bacteriological war fought by the ancient Vilani.

The Aslan on Waorl found the world to be easy pickings, with no inhabitants
to contend with and plenty of arable land to reap. They have had to be
cautious with the legacy of the ancient nuclear war, but they have
minimized the threat of falling satellites by systematically blowing them
up with starship armaments.

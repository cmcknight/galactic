
Ganulf (1307) was the location of a tragic incident in 1084 during the
Fourth Frontier War. A Zhodani strike force penetrated the defenses of the
planet and bombarded Imperial Marine munitions stores, detonating numerous
nuclear explosions on the world. Subsequent environmental damage to the
world was quite severe, including the destruction of the planet's thin
atmosphere. To this day, Ganulf remains a lifeless radioactive rock.


Tobia (3215) is one of the rucial worlds of the Regency, anchoring the
rimward extreme of its defenses. Tobia is not only a subsector capital, it
is one of only 16 TL-15 industrial worlds in the Regency, and is the
rimward-ost of these. In the antebellum period, Tobia had also been the
sector capital, but the Regency has dispensed with this fatuous legalism,
as it only holds one quarter of the sector.

Tobia is also the headquarters of the 128th Fleet, whose area of
responsibility is actually to trailing in Quarantine District 5A. However,
because of the lack of suitable facilities in the fleet's AOR, its
administrative headquarters (and center for scheduled maintenance
availabilities and overhaul) is placed farther to the rear than is the case
with the three other human fleets.

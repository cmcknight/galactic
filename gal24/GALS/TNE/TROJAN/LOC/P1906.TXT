
Bantral (1906) was the 1122 site of talks between the Domain of Deneb and
the Aslan Ikhtealyo clan. The Ikhtealyo, which had a long history of trade
with the Imperium, desired an amicable solution that would allow trade and
not require open warfare. However, such sentiments were complicated by
other factions on both sides. Many human worlds were inclined to go to war
with the Aslan intruders, and other Aslan clans preferred war as well.

One such clan was the militant Eakhtiyho, and its motivations were
two-fold. First, war would allow it to simply take what it wanted; Imperial
weakness made it likely that this would prove true. Second, by pursuing
war, the Eakhtiyho could undercut the power of the Ikhtealyo, their Tlaukhu
rivals. A solution that allowed the Eakhtiyho to gain strength at the
expense of the Imperium and the Ikhtealyo was irrestible to them. Thus
Eakhtiyho policy was to provide military assistance to all Ihatei forces
(regardless of clan affiliation) who pursued military conquest of new lands
in the Imperium. This would add fuel to the fire and give greater strength
to the Eakhtiyho. Attempts at negotiation were therefore foredoomed to
failure so long as the Eakhtiyho figured in the equation, and their policy
was to forcibly insert themselves into the equation at every opportunity.

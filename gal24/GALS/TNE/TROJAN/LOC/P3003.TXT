
The Imperial research station at Fidelis (3003) was evacuated in the
pre-Collapse period when it became impossible to defend. The present
population of the system comprise an asteriod mining colony made up of
families intending to make a life in the system, not corporate employees
who come and go based upon their contracts. These settlers gave the system
its new name as a commitment that their world would not be abandoned like
its predecessor but would remain a valuable and valued member of the
Regency.


NORA'A

During the Ihatei invasions before the Collapse, the Aslan overran Florian
League worlds, Nora'a (0321), Attye (0122) and Vadada (0523).

Vadada was taken by a joint Yerlyaruiwo and Khaukeairl Aslan military
force. Formerly a world of the Florian League, Vadada was defended by a
powerful naval force, bolstered by the power of recovered Ancient weapons
and black globes. Sheer numbers won out for the Aslan, however with Vadada
falling to them in early 1120. Eventually, the Khaukeairl clan assumed full
control over the world. The clan of pomp and circumstance, the Khaukeairl
have never shirked from an opportunity to boast about this jewel in their
crown. It is uncertain how much Ancient technology was captured by the
Aslan when they conquered Vadada, but considering that they have maintained
its TL-15 rating, it is safe to say that some form of artificial support
has aided their cause.

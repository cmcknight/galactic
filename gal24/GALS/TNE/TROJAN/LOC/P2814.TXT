
Dreadnought (2814), formerly known as 971-852 had its crust cracked during
the Ancients' final war, destroying most indigenous life. The world's
tectonics plates are fragile to this day; volcanism remains extensive, and
large areas are prone to quakes and tsunamis.

When first contacted by the IISS in 504, the world still had a small human
population eking out an existence on their island dwellings by such means
as the limited edible plantlife and cannibalism, a practice which provided
certain proteins not available in the local wildlife. The IISS introduced
livestock to provide a socially acceptable source of protein. The
inhabitants gradually changed from a settled, agricultural culture to a
more nomadic, herding one. To the Scout Service's regret, they persisted in
eating the old and crippled humans. When the scouts last reappraised the
world in 852, this population had become extinct.

The world is still a hazardous environment as its crust remains weak. The
world has been resettled under the auspices of the Ministry of the Interior
with its new grandiose and courageous name: "Fear God and Dread Nought."
This unwieldy name is officially shortened to "Dreadnought" for normal
usage.

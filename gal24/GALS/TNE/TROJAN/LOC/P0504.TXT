
Sable des Etos (0504) is currently at war with Strend (0505). When large
rich deposits of carbonaceous ores and radioactives were discovered at
Sable des Etos in 1152, the Sablean government was at a loss for the
necessary labor to mine and process these resources. Megacorporation
Sternmetal threatened to pull out if this situation was not rectified via
aggressive government programs to encourage migration to the belt.

The Sablean Raag Consortium did not wish to suffer through the turmoil that
a Sternmetal pullout would have caused and began to facilitate the
immigration of Strendian dissidents to Sable des Etos. The Strendian
Consolidate had long been known as a brutally oppressive government whose
stagnant economy would have caused widespread unrest if it were not for the
strongarm tactics of the military.

The resultant outpouring of immigrants to Sable des Etos did not sit well
with the Consolidati, who immediately undertook a campaign to defame Sable
des Etos as a "slave labor camp" for immigrant Strendians. Under this
banner, the Consolidati have conducted five decades of on-again, off-again
war with Sable des Etos. For Sable des Etos, the war is a minor
inconvenience and a "cost of doing business." For the Strendians, the war
has been quite tragic, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of millions,
while simultaneously billions more continue to immigrate to either Sable
des Etos, Sam's World or the Aslan-occupied worlds to rimward.

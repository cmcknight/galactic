
Eleson (1308) an underpopulated member of the Belgardian Sojourn before the
Civil War and Ihatei invasions, was easily conquered by the Aslan.
Strategic maps revealed that the world was rich in crystals and other
resources. In short: an economic diamond mine waiting to be exploited. To a
certain extent, the world's resources were overstated, but Aslan hysteria
over the purported value of the world brought some of the most powerful
Tlaukhu blocs to the world. These blocs quickly exploited and consumed the
world's valuable but limited resources and afterward found that they had
nothing better to do than fight each other over one claim or another. At
the present time, the world averages three to five full-fledged fueds
between clans at any given time. Conventional warfare is anethema to the
planet.

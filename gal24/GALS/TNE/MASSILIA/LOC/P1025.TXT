The population descends from a lost expedition from the first centuries of
the Third Imperium. Cut off from the rest of the stellar community, the
Trinitans evolved a conservative culture based on stability and tradition.
The collapse had almost no effect on the planet, except for the fact that
the world was being held captive by a foreign power, and Virus effectively
removed the invaders. Now, Far Trinity is governed by its most traditional
legislative branch, a group of 19 individuals known as "the Makers of
Rules", elected to single six-year terms.

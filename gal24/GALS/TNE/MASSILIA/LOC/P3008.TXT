Zabel: Zabel is currently home of the Corsair band "Black Rain."  This unit
took over the corporate retreat for a minor corporation back in 1126.
They then forced the company's support personel into producing amuntion for
their group, and maintaining their starships.  As the world wasn't that
important, it wasn't retaken before virus hit.  As most ships avoided the
planet, only a Xboat entered with the virus.  The vessel slammed itself
into the old starport, damaging some of the industrial production, and the
communications did cause a collapse, but the band was able to restore the
infrastructure to a TL9 capacity.  The "Black Rain" are currently at TL12,
and have one operational Patrol Cruiser, and two Merc Cruisers in mothballs
at the downport.  Due to slaves taken  from other worlds, or "rescued" from
disabled ships, the actual population of the planet is sometimes as high as
2000.  However, only the families  of the original support crew live on
planet (thus its small size).  In fact, Zabelian forces have recently
subjigated Dolenar.

This hospitable world was a vacation location for
rich business men. The planet was held by a company which had agreement by
the Imperium, to handle this planet. The installation mainly consists in
Hotels and entertainment facilities. The grounded starport was very luxuous
for the number of people living on this planet. 
When the virus strikes, The starport exploded due to Hydrogen release. As
the Starport was quite far from the starport (200Km) there weren't much
casualities. Most of the poeple left to buildings for a while. Actually,
the population was divided by 5, not because of the Virus but because of
lack of surviving skill. This little society tried to organized itself.
Half of them lives in the hotels, the others are spread in the country
side. The people have several cars and very few small weapons.

Gasha (X250545-0) was a dry and uninhabited world which has been colonized
by scientists. A big research facility was built. Their main domain was
genetics and cybernetics. During the collapse, they were hit by viruses.
All there computers went mad. The scientists had time to leave the
complexe. They went to the desert. Now they live like nomades who follow
the rains. They found some desert plants (some kind of cactus) which help
them to sustain their lives. Sometime small animals are added to their
meals. Their survive is mostely due to their scientific knowledge. 
The research center is held by a Virus which created some machines to help
him. Trying to get some salvage from this center is quite deadful. The
Virus, which named himself 'Herus' is a father for his robot, and would
like to have more human to built new children... (Have you seen Screamers?)

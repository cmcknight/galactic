Korthalis was like a twin to Appoma, before the Virus.
But they got happy times as an God strain virus infected the main
computer of the scoutbase. But at least it didn't kill everybody.
The virus is catched at the scotbase situated at the moon of the main
planet, and so needs shuttles to controll his servants. It look's quit
carefully, that the high services of his believers are made carefully,
which means that they hold the spaceport at least workable.
It doesn't need a spaceport, cause the shuttles are quit beautyfull, if
you like antiquarity.

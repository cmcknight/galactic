When the Virus struck, this TL 7 world suffered no catastrophic, immediate
effects, despite the fact that the whole population lived in underground,
sealed tunnels. But, with all interstellar trade gone, there was simply not
enough food for the whole population to survive. A revolution ended with the
assassination of all government bureaucrats. Many people died from the
fighting and from starvation. Some cannibalism cases occurred. After a
while, people started eating Chirpers as meat. Later on, when the population
stabilized and the production of vegetables in the tunnels was significant,
it was obvious that Chirpers were the only source of food. The survivors
have already become used to eat them, so, rather than become vegetarians,
they developed the practice of herding Chirpers and using them as food. A
determinant factor was also that nothing totally unproductive could be kept,
so, in order to allow Chirpers to survive, their meat had to be consumed.
This practice is viewed with disgust by other Geonee worlds.

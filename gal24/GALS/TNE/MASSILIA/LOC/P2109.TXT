Murcia (2109) was never much of a factor in interstellar politics
despite its high population and status as largest exporter of
agroproducts in the Khishan cluster. After the general Collapse of the
Imperium, the Murcian government soon followed suit. Political power
was seized by the Vilani-style Murcian agricultural bureaux. A supreme
council of nine magistrates now rules Murcia with an iron fist. Not
possessing of much in the way of high technology, Murcia has been
little affected by Virus other than the occasional gratuitous orbital
bombardment by Vampire fleets. Now, more than ever, it is crucial that
Murcia meets its agricultural quotas to ensure the continued survival
of its citizens. Ironically, the oppressive measures taken by the
magistrates have had a deleterious effect on the planet's agricultural
output.

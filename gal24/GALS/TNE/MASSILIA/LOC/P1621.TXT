Before the collapse, Revie was governed by a feudal system based on
technical classes. When the Virus struck, the world was left in chaos for
several decades, until a single, charismatic leader was able to re-unify all
the planet. His daughter is the current leader, with the title of Queen.
Under her rule, Revie population has actually experienced a steady recovery
and has, in fact, slightly exceeded the pre-Collapse level.
	In the last decade, Revie has been able to put in operation a small fleet
of half a dozen old starships, under the command of a former Naval officer
who hibernated in 1130 and was discovered in-system in 1185. Some scouts
have contacted Forquee (Forquee subsector, 1719).

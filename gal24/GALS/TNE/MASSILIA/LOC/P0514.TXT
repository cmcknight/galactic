The TED at Kaflowe is one of this guys who treats his underlings good,
not as good as his dogs, but who does ?
Part of the population decline isn't connected to virus, but is part of
a bigger plan of cleansing the universe from the betrayers.
For this holy aim he killed just 50.000 people (one sixted of the pop.),
and he is still working. That's also the reason, why he tries to buy or
size a jump capable vessel, as to find all of them. The betrayers killed
the emperor, released virus, and last but not least invented ketchup.
You may ask who are this betrayers ? It's quit easy to find them, they
aren't able to roll their tongue vertically. Try it yourself !

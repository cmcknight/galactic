Three different populations inhabit the planet. One, numbering over
100,000, descends from Geonee refugees from Shiwonee ("Lost Geonee"), who
were stranded in the planet when fleeing back from the Nes'Vra subsector,
after the start of the Geoneecide. They are governed by a charismatic,
technically-oriented oligarchy. The second, slightly smaller, descends from
ordinary refugees from all over the subsector, settled in the world by a
corporation during Hard Times. They are governed by a democratic system. The
last one, nomadic in nature and numbering just a few thousands, descends
from the original, true inhabitants of the world, and are governed by a
self-perpetuating oligarchy based around a few families.
	The two major populations inhabit areas thousands of kilometers away, but
are aware of each other. However, contacts have not been peaceful. The
Geonee community is "humanophobic", due to harsh memories from the Geoneecide.

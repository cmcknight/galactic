Marcusen is the main player in this subsector. It's not real a PE, but
more like the family. Not to say that the aristocrats are evil. No, you
can't really say this. They just used the fortunate moment, and toppled
the rolers of Jonen and Uson, and putting members of their family at
top.
So they managed to make everybody happy. The Jonean and Usonean get a
new TED (backed by the King's Fleets, consisting of an old but luxurious
Yacht(jump 1 cause most of this vessel is made from rope and tape) and a
Free Trader), and the Marcusean get 300 times their own population.
But after they lost an scout attempting to jump to Mannai Nila, they
just try to stabilize their stronghold and have stopped exploring the
surroundings.

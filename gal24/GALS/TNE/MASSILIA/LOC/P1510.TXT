    Entire planet surface is ice. Anamoni was settled in the late 
400's, soon after the First Survey located substantial mineral resources
buried far beneath the planet's icy shroud. Miners came in to bore
through the frozen global sea and the local atmosphere was made almost
breathable by the release of oxygen freed from the melted ice.

    Still Anamoni's Climate is eminently lethal to humans, and workers are
forced to perform their jobs in well-insulated vehicles and protective
suits. These roving miners set out from Anampont, Anamoni's only city,
for extended tours of rugged duty out on the ice sheets.  
Anamoni's inhabitants are a resourceful folk, forced to improvise and
innovate out of necessity. The small population of far-ranging
individualists are wholly self-reliant in nature, but they have no
qualms about cooperating when such action is merited.  Anamonians are
typically unresponsive to offworlders, preferring to extol the virtures
of their own society rather than hear tales of others.
The planets is governed by Anampont's urbanites, who viote on issues
via the city's comm network. Effectivly all residents take turns at
governemnt duties, as other jobs periodically call many away from
Anampont onto the ice.  Interestingly, a lenient set of laws applies to
those in the cty, while harsher, more stringent rules take effect
outside Anampont's civilized Environment.

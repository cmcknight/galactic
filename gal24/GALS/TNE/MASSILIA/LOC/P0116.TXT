Appoma was never quit important, but at least they've had an scoutbase.
And that's I think why they've had the population of 800 people.
As virus was striking, it take a comparatively small toll, just every
second person. But one thing that is no problem for a bigger population
showed up at this small group of survivers. They got a quit anoying
genetical disease, which made the most of the women unfertile, and most
of the newborn girlbabies never reached maturity. The result of this is
a 3:1 ratio of men to women.

That's the reason why this groups started to use their two remaining
scouts (jump 1 capable) to salvage TL 11 equipment at Juweit (115), and
barter or steal women from Shigi (214). Just in this way they're able to
maintain their population. (And with 400 persons they aren't able to
maintain a D starport, that's why they get an E).

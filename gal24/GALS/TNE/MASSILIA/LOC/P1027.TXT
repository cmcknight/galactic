The population descends of refugees from Hard Times. Having nothing but an
empty, pleasant planet before them, the population actually started growing
immediately, once the TL drop was accepted and the scarce present nobles
lost all influence. Recuperation was speed up in 1182, when a secret naval
research station dating to Rebellion times was discovered. Today, seven
different "Cities" manage their affairs independently, although limited
cooperation is possible through the City Confederacy. Most of the
traditional Geonee culture is maintained. The Starport has been constructed
in the last five years using resources from all the Third Confederation. The
old orbital complex is partially active again.

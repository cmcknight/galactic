Datruma (D362634-8) is a satellite of a gas giant. As the satellite was
quite good living, the grounded people could go around the rare forests.
The virus which striked the orbital starport crashed all the computer in
several minutes. Many people (50%) had time to leave to facility using
emergency pods. As this facility was on a stable orbit, it didn't crashed
on the countryside. 20 year ago, Datrumans started the reconstruction of
this starport. But the main trouble is that this facility is more a hulk
than a starport. All moving panel are wield due to the vaccuum. The actual
orbital station have several shuttles and one SDB.

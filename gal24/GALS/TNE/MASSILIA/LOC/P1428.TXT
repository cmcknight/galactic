Starport: Poor                   Size: Large (13600-15200 km)
Atmosphere: Dense                Hydrographics: 90% water
Population: 3 million            Govt: Self Perpetuating Oligarch
Law Level: Extreme               Technology: Pre-Stellar
 
The world is governed by a self-perpetuating oligarchy descended from
Imperial nobles and Corporate Executive Officers from Hortalez et Cie, who
took over all the available resources after the Collapse. The world is
technophobic, and so Technological Level has stabilized 4 levels under the
original one. Nevertheless, population has experienced a slight recovery.
	Nindaro has been recontacted by scouts from the Geonee Confederation, but
the ruling oligarchy is keeping this fact secret from the general
population. The confederation has still not decided its policy with the
Nindaro government.

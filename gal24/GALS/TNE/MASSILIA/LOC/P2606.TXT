Galus: Galus's Representive Democracy has so far succesfully fended off all
the raids from Athay, but due to their small number of ships, their luck
may not hold out long.  The government is willing to offer astounding rates
for working starships to aid in defense, or a mercenary unit to put a stop
to the raids.

	Around 27,000 million of Geonee died in the system in the Collapse, 
when virus took over the systems of the orbital cities and the planet's
environmental controls. A Permanent Salvaging Station of the Confederation
has been established to obtain technological items from this once heavily
populated, industrial, TL 16 system. Whole starships have been recovered 
and refitted. The huge number of Geonee dead bodies found in the system 
has caused many Geonee to refer to Lagna as "The Cemetery".

Khipshunam was one of the most populated world. This small
planet mostly built around big facility. They produced most electronic
devices, computers and weaponry. As Virus entered the computer network, most
of the facilities were turned into death trap. A TED arose, helped by the
discovery of undestroyed docking zone. Her strength mostly come from high
speed vehicles and weaponry. The population was reduced by 1000. It's
already hard to land in a boneyard, but it's worst to live in one 
all the time.

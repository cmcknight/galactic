When the Collapse hit, Iggarir (2007) had already endured its share of
hardship. During the Civil War, the system was the site of several
major battles, many of which brought some of the world's gravitic
cities crashing down from the sky. Iggarir, while possessing of a
breathable atmosphere and ample hydrosphere, sits perched on an axial
tilt of over 51 degrees, making annual climatic changes quite severe.
As a result, Iggariri generally lived in mobile floating arcologies
before the Collapse, with the surface of the world reserved for
agriculture and mining. As the effects of Virus emanated from Core like
a raging tsunami, Iggarir was hit hard. Vampire attacks brought most of
the cities crashing down, killing all of their inhabitants. Only the 32
arcologies that had already grounded themselves in the planet's
equatorial region survived. The overlord of Iggarir was not one of the
lucky people to have survived. With their government decapitated, the
Iggariri split up into rival factions based at the grounded arcologies.
Where two to four of the arcologies were grounded in the same locality,
arcology unions formed. All in all, thirteen separate states now exist
in Iggarir, most of which are governed by a technologically elevated
dictator. The rival states wage war with one another frequently,
fighting over the world's scarce resources and the artifacts in its
ruins. Because of the extremes to which the high population of Iggarir
must go in order to survive, the law level of most states is extremely
high.

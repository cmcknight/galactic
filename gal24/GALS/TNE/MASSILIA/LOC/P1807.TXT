The survivors on Ketola (1807) are the descendents of the two
corporations that once governed the planet, Theedin Research and Tenia
Incorporated. While these two companies were at one time quite
antagonistic toward one another, in the New Era, the two clannish
groups have found they must cooperate to survive the icy environment of
their native planet.

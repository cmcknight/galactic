Home of the Shiwonee minor human race, with 1.3 Gs and 1.5 atm pressure.
Geologically very active, with frequent earthquakes and an important
number of volcanoes.
	The planet was left in complete chaos after the artificially provoked
earthquakes in Hard Times and the Virus infection. The social organization
disappeared almost completely, substituted by practical, survival criteria.
Twenty years later, a Female Revolution re-unified the planet, completely
changing the Geonee culture. Shiwonee is now governed by an egalitarian
democratic system. The females are granted equal rights, a fact that strikes
Geonee from other worlds.

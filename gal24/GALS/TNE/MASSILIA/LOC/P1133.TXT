	Garency was nuked during the Rebellion, and extensive areas of the surface
are still radioactive. This has caused a high mutation rate in the
population during the last seventy years. Roughly one of every three
newborns have at least some minor mutation, from face deformations to extra
members.
	Around one hundred major mutually independent cities hold half of the
population of the world, with the rest living in small villages in rural
areas or in nomadic tribes or ravager groups. In almost all of the cities,
newborn mutants are either killed or expulsed out of the city. Some groups
of mutants raise these children.
	Most of the cities are governed by some totalitarian city council and keep
numerous armed forces.

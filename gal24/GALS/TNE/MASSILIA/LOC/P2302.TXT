Elan (2302) Mina (2401) and Solarda (2403) are Virus-controlled states
and satellites of the Black Curtain. Elan and Solarda, in addition to
salvage sites for Vampire ships in service to the fleets of the
Curtain, are also exporters of shipbound human slaves. The inhabitants
of Mina have successfully fled into the underground and have, to date,
avoided such terrible fates.

Roughly half of the surface of the planet is desertic. The population
inhabits the more temperate areas  in a network of communities. The world is
governed by The Farmers Council, a charismatic oligarchy formed by the
descendants of landlords and executives of former agricultural corporations.
The world has suffered occasional raids from the Vampire Fleet based at
Strogy.

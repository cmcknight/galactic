Athay: The TED at Athay is currently involved in building a naval fleet.
However, the few ships he has managed to salvage have jump drives, but he
lacks skilled astrogators.  As it is, they can only manage the 1 parsec
jump to Galus.  The TED has been trying to get some astrogators, and is
also trying to capture some ships from Galus, in the hopes of both  getting
a pilot, and getting another vessel for his fleet.

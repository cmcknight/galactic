Lattaunist  was an agricultural world. Most of the population
was divided in a big city containing a starport facility, and many modern
farms. The majority of the porpulation was Chipers who were used as
agricultural hands. When Virus strikes, the city was nearly destroyed by a
nuclear explosion due to the crash of a hugh freighter. Most of Humans
where killed, so the rate of Chipers growed. No one is living in the
wreckage of the town now.

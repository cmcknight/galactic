Wikk (2010) is governed by a druidic cult who control the planet's
unique animated plantlife supply. Wikk's flora contains muscle tissue,
enabling it to mindlessly walk and extend stalks for pollination
purposes. The temples of the cult are actually wood constructions built
upon foundations of "walking" trees that take the druidic priests
around the countryside to preach the gospel. The Wikkie plantlife was a
novelty in the pre-Collapse era, but in the New Era it is a primary
building and manufacturing material. While the druidic government of
Wikk are not very progressive, the planet harbors a rather active
scientific community who manage to thrive mostly due to indifference on
the part of the druids. The Wikkies mounted a brief interstellar travel
mission (justifying it to their druidic masters as a chance to spread
the faith) in 1172. The three salvaged ships were sent in the general
direction of Core sector and were never again heard from. The Wikkies
have abandoned further attempts at regaining the stars.

Dolenar: This planet is in an undesirable position indeed.  In late 1197, a
raiding party from Zabel took the starport, and the main city.  In return
for not being sold into slavery, the Dolenarians operate their Starport as
a R&R facility for the Black Rain, while they are off duty.  Dolenar is
also forced to pay tribute in the form of fuel and repairs to any visiting
Zabelan ship.

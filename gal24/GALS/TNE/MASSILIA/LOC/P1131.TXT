	This planet was not very heavily affected by the Virus. The economy, based
on exporting agroproducts, receded greatly, but, although the production
dropped, it was far enough to sustain the local population. The Central City
was only abandoned after 5 years, causing the collapse of the democratic
system. This left a power vacuum which was later filled by  the
establishment of The Producers' League, an alliance of technocratic
landlords which still governs the planet. Most of the traditional Geonee
culture is intact, with the landlords taking the place of the nobility.

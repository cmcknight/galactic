I've done some work on the canopus sector, including collapsing it. I have
put up some sector and subsector maps, from both the pre- and post-collapse
periods. I intend to put up the traditional subsector commetaries (highest
TL & population, etc) at some stage. The maps should be accessible from:
http://home.clear.net.nz/pages/rboleyn/trav/Canopus/canopus.htm

You can download the sector, in both it's states from there, in zipped up
Gal text files. If anyone wants I can email them, instead. Comments on them
are welcome.

In my interpretation of the Rats 'n' Cats system dot map there's only one
system that is J-3 away from all its neighbours - all the clusters are J-2.
There are few mains of any real size in Canopus, which is made up of
numerous half-subsector sized clusters. There are 392 systems in the
Canopus sector, thus only 30% of the hexes have systems - low even for a
sparsely filled sector.

My pocket empire (which needs a name) is going to be in the
rimward-trailing corner of subsector 'K'. At the moment it's going to be
run by the remnants of a group that backed one of the more less extreme
factions, and managed to avoid getting completely trashed by the collapse.
They lost their ship building capacity until the last few years. The only
world that currently has a class A starport has TL11, which is also a
recent phenomonen. There is a world with TL13, but it has only a B
starport, and a population of 8 million, so while some of the PE's ships
will have some nice shiny TL13 gadgets the bulk of their exploration fleet
will be TL11, and internal trade will be with TL11 vessels. However the
capital was at TL13 before the collapse and was (is) a Hi pop world, so
there should be at least a few TL13 relics for system defence (and perhaps
a few recently repaired for scouting).

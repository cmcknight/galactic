Boreal Subsector (Circa 1120)
         As an important Solomani subsector, Boreal is also one of the key
    gateways to Spica sector.  Boreal (0623) the world, is the subsector
    capital and sector corporate headquarters for Transstar, the largest
    Solomani transportation company and a Party subsidiary.  Their frontier
    terminus is J-3 beyond into the Flux subsector.
         The Kapybare, named by Tupi explorers (who eventually settled
    Tupindur [0317]), are very close in all respects to the Terran South
    American rodents.  One story goes that the Tupi actually released
    them on Kapybarrdos (0123), but is widely dismissed given the advanced
    state of that alien society (TL6).
         Nereides (0122), a water world one parsec from Kapybarrdos, is
    also the home of an alien race, the Nereidians.  Being aquatic and
    considering their extreme law level, it is no surprise that few contacts
    have been made with this race.  In the early days of the Solomani
    colonization/expansion into the sector, it has been said that a crack
    dolphin Scout team had disappeared here, but this has remained an
    unsubstantiated rumor to this day.
 
         The Boreal Subsector contains 32 systems with a known
    population of 21.484 billion sapients. The highest population known
    is 9.50 billion at Tigr. The highest Tech Level known is E at
    Boreal. The best Starports known are Type-A at Athabasca, Hialbedo and
    Boreal.

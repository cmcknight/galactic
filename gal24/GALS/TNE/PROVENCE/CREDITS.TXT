
Provence Sector / Credits
-------------------------

This sector lies completely within Vargr space. As such, the majority
populations listed in the UWP of these worlds are Vargr. Humans, if
present, will be in the minority and listed in the Remarks column with an
M.

Sector Notes: I ran into a bit of a problem when generating the subsectors
for this sector. I used DGP's "Vilani & Vargr." The dot map (pg.48) and the
library info provided did not always match up. I've had to do some
modifications to get everything to make some sort of sense. These changes
are as follows:

   * Dzarrvaer, the capital of the Dzarrgh Federate, is listed in the
     library data (pg.53) as being at 224. There isn't a world at this
     location on the dot map. Instead, I made it the world at 225.

   * Ouskathoerz is listed in the library data (pg.54) as being at 405.
     There isn't a world at this location on the dot map. Instead, I made
     it the world at 406.

   * Ghaez-Larrgh is listed in the library data (pg.54) as being at 803.
     There isn't a world at this location on the dot map. Instead, I made
     it the world at 903.

   * Kirg is listed in the library data (pg.53) as being at 731. There
     isn't a world at this location on the dot map. Instead, I made Kirg to
     be the world at 831.

   * Igunfaksa, the capital of the Irrgh Manifest, is listed in the library
     data (pg.53) as being at 1731. On the dot map, this would place it in
     the territory of the Glory of Taarskoerzn. The library data (pg.54)
     also states that the Glory of Taarskoerzn split the Irrgh Manifest in
     two with Igunfaksa in the "larger trailing half." The dot map clearly
     shows that the spinward portion of the Irrgh Manifest is larger.
     Therefore, I've decided to put Igunfaksa in the spinward portion at
     1431, which is closer to 1731 than the trailing portion.

   * According to the library data on pg.54 of "Vilani & Vargr", there are
     only 9 worlds to the Lair Protectorate in 1120. The dot map shows 10
     (8 in Provence, 2 in Ngathksirz). I went with the dot map.

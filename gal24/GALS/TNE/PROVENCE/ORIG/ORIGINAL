This sector lies completely within Vargr space. As such, the majority
populations listed in the UWP of these worlds are Vargr. Humans, if
present, will be in the minority and listed in the Remarks column with an

Sector Notes: I ran into a bit of a problem when generating the subsectors
for this sector. I used DGP's "Vilani & Vargr." The dot map (pg.48) and the
library info provided did not always match up. I've had to do some
modifications to get everything to make some sort of sense. These changes
are as follows:

   * Dzarrvaer, the capital of the Dzarrgh Federate, is listed in the
     library data (pg.53) as being at 224. There isn't a world at this
     location on the dot map. Instead, I made it the world at 225.

   * Ouskathoerz is listed in the library data (pg.54) as being at 405.
     There isn't a world at this location on the dot map. Instead, I made
     it the world at 406.

   * Ghaez-Larrgh is listed in the library data (pg.54) as being at 803.
     There isn't a world at this location on the dot map. Instead, I made
     it the world at 903.

   * Kirg is listed in the library data (pg.53) as being at 731. There
     isn't a world at this location on the dot map. Instead, I made Kirg to
     be the world at 831.

   * Igunfaksa, the capital of the Irrgh Manifest, is listed in the library
     data (pg.53) as being at 1731. On the dot map, this would place it in
     the territory of the Glory of Taarskoerzn. The library data (pg.54)
     also states that the Glory of Taarskoerzn split the Irrgh Manifest in
     two with Igunfaksa in the "larger trailing half." The dot map clearly
     shows that the spinward portion of the Irrgh Manifest is larger.
     Therefore, I've decided to put Igunfaksa in the spinward portion at
     1431, which is closer to 1731 than the trailing portion.

   * According to the library data on pg.54 of "Vilani & Vargr", there are
     only 9 worlds to the Lair Protectorate in 1120. The dot map shows 10
     (8 in Provence, 2 in Ngathksirz). I went with the dot map.

Llaezgaen Subsector: The Llaezgaen Subsector has an estimated population in
1202 of approximately 2.0 billion, a decline of 96.6% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Llaegharrgh has the highest population (800 million) as well as
the highest tech level rating (10). The Llaezgaen subsector had an
estimated population in 1120 of approximately 60.1 billion. Its highest
population was 20 billion at Tughghorr and Vo Oeg. Llaegharrgh had the
highest tech level (16).

Subsector Notes:
(Refer to Vilani & Vargr pg.54-55) In 1114, unhappy with the menacing
attitude of Faarzgaen (704), the Llaeghskath Interacterate was formed by
Llaegharrgh (604) and Ouskathoerz (406). Believing in technology and
scientific thought, these worlds sought to pursue an independent course
from the Empire of Varroerth. Many of their spinward neighbors joined them.

The religious leaders of Faarzgaen were so outraged by this development
that they too seceded from the Empire to form the Jihad of Faarzgaen. The
leaders despised the Interacterate for their "ungodly" beliefs and felt
that they needed to be eradicated from existence. Enlisting the aid of some
of their trailing neighbors, they went to war against the Llaeghskath
Interacterate. Those worlds which would not willingly join with the Jihad
were forcibly annexed.

The religion is centered around the god Faarzgaen. His worshippers believe
that he communicates to them through feelings. If you felt hungry, you were
supposed to eat. If you wanted to kill someone, you were being commanded by
Faarzgaen to do just that. The Jihad was brutal, even to its own citizens.
Heretics were put to death. No personal entertainment devices were
permitted nor was there any money. Off-worlders were paid in hard assets
such as precious metals, finished goods, and even slaves from captured
worlds.

With the exception of a temporary cease-fire in 1118, enacted when word of
Strephon's death reached the region, the war was non-stop. The Jihad's
devotion to eradicating the Interacterate was relentless. They might even
have won the war were it not for a crucial mistake. The turning point came
in 1125 when they decided that further expansion trailward was necessary
(see Vorvoun for more details). The new regional governor, Gen Rungakh, was
already annoyed with the ongoing feud. She issued a proclamation stating
that neither group be allowed to expand any further. While the
Interacterate complied, the Jihad did not. When the Jihad began to forcibly
convert more worlds over to Faarzgaen, Rungakh began to retaliate by
ordering all Jihad warships found outside of their 1125 boundaries to be
attacked. Forced to fight a war on 2 fronts, the Jihad weakened.

In 1128, the Jihad agreed to another cease-fire. Negotiators stepped in to
try and find a way to reintegrate both sides back into the Empire. During
this time, the Jihad began to build more ships to recoup their losses.
After 3 years of negotiating, the Jihad killed the peace negotiators from
the Empire and the Interacterate and renewed the war.

The madness of the Jihad finally came to an end in 1135. The massive
Vampire Fleet from Anghikh and Kaegrogz invaded and annihilated Faarzgaen.
The planetoids themselves were pounded so heavily that they shattered into
pieces. Even the inhabitable Jihad worlds suffered heavily. The death toll
was in the tens of billions.

The Llaegskath Interacterate also took a beating from Virus. However,
unlike the Jihad of Faarzgaen, it survived. Only Llaegharrgh (TL10) and Vo
Dikh (TL8) remained intact enough to carry on the name of the state. Other
worlds have begun to rebound from the devastation. Before the end of the
decade, it is hoped that Ae Uer (302), Taktelugh (305), Sa Thaen (306), Urr
Orr (401), To Oukan (502), Ouskathoerz (406), and Ung Uksa (606) will be
able to, and want to, rejoin the Interacterate.

Vorvoun Subsector: The Vorvoun Subsector has an estimated population in
1202 of approximately 1.2 billion, a decline of 95.7% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Aekaedho has the highest population (500 million)while Vorvoun
has the highest tech level rating (10). The Vorvoun subsector had an
estimated population in 1120 of approximately 27 billion. Its highest
population was 9 billion at Knak and Aelues. Vorvoun had the highest tech
level (15).

Subsector Notes:
From 1115-1120, the Jihad of Faarzgaen invaded and enslaved three worlds:
Ghaez-Larrgh (903), Aedzuedza (904), and Doughaerr (906). By 1120, 75% of
the population of Ghaez-Larrgh had either been enslaved or killed (Vilani &
Vargr pg54). By 1121, the entire population of Aedzueda had been killed. By
1122, the entire population of Doughaerr had either been enslaved or
killed. The butchering and enslavement of Ghaez-Larrgh continued until only
a few hundred thousand people remained. This became the breeder pool for
future slaves.

In need of more "hard assets," the Jihad began to expand trailward in 1125.
They began to attack Kugh (1002) and Aeleus (1003). Gen Rungakh, the newly
appointed regional governor, put a stop to it. As the first step towards
re-integrating the two warring factions back into the Empire, further
expansion had to be halted. Forced to fight a war on two fronts, the Jihad
weakened. Although the Jihad resumed their attacks after the peace
negotiations failed in 1131, they were not able to capture any other worlds
before Virus wiped them out in 1135.

Local corsairs which traded with the Jihad of Faarzgaen often received
unusual forms of payment: gems, precious metals, and even slaves. The bases
at Viksougu (1009), Eg Orrou (1108), and Adhkfurral (1201) profited from
this arrangement. Today, they're in bad shape. The base at Eg Orrou was
completely wiped out by Virus. The downport at Viksougu came alive and
kills anyone that tries to enter it. The support structure for the base in
the mountains of Adhkfurral was blasted by Vampire ships. Those present
fell with it as it slid down into the crushing pressures of the lower
elevations. The population at Viksougu is 55 and the population at
Adhkfurral is 85. Neither of these populations is large enough to sustain a
healthy gene pool. Without an influx of Vargr, or escape, these populations
will gradually die off.

Gunog (1405), formerly known as Ksarthangtsouts, was once run by a
restrictive, almost stifling bureaucracy. In an effort to preserve some
semblance of unity after the capital city sank, the surviving government
officials drafted up several reforms. Each island was permitted to rule
itself so long as those rules did not conflict with rules established by
the world government. Representatives from the islands convene to run the
world government. As noted by the drastic difference in pre and
post-Collapse law levels, there has been very little legislation enacted to
curb the islands' freedom. As such, it has allowed the islands a chance to
concentrate on rebuilding. So far, the inhabitants have not abused their
new level of freedom.

Vorvoun (1505) has remained somewhat intact though nowhere near the level
it once was. In recent years trade has resumed with a couple of other
worlds: Kaengku (1605) and Farrurgneng (1403). A pair of survey vessels are
scheduled to begin exploration of the Grnouf Jump-1 Main from Aekaedho
(1106) to Foukakh (2405) later this year (1202).

Grnouf Subsector: The Grnouf Subsector has an estimated population in 1202
of approximately 6 billion, a decrease of 60% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Lair and Firgvaar have the highest population (2 billion) while
Lair has the highest tech level rating (13). The Grnouf Subsector had an
estimated population in 1120 of approximately 15 billion. Its highest
population was 5 billion at Anur. Lair had the highest tech level (15).

Lair Protectorate Notes:
In 777, Lair (2402) declared its independence from the Empire of Varroerth.
It was accompanied by Khvhaergvaetsorrgh (2501), Firgvaar (2401),
Fraets-Vog (2302), Zhorurn (2301), and Kaarlag (Ngathksirz 2440).
"Embracing everything that is truly Vargr, the Lair Protectorate is based
on the basic precepts of charisma and responsible change." (Vilani & Vargr
pg.54). The Empire just shrugged and ignored the Protectorate. The
Protectorate ignored the Empire in return. Over the next 300+ years,
Aertsvad (2101), Oeghzvar (2102), Zargvaetsr (2001), and Khaevu (Ngathksirz
2240) joined the Protectorate. As the Protectorate began to really prosper,
the regional governor grew somewhat envious but took no action. The
Protectorate is also technologically minded and would have quite an
advantage if a civil war broke out.

Unlike their brethren, the Vargr of the Lair Protectorate did not join in
the great feast in Corridor. Their resources were focused on internal
matters. Civil unrest on Lair threatened to break apart the Protectorate.
Reform minded Ulurs Otsunga stabilized matters with legislation designed to
curtail restrictions over personal freedoms. His timing was fortunate as he
soon had to face an even greater threat, Virus.

When word reached the Protectorate about the coming of Virus, decisive
action was immediately taken. Worlds prepared for war. Caches of technology
were created and hidden deep underground. While representatives of the
Empire scoffed at what they felt was a hoax, the Protectorate secured its
borders and remained alert for any possible sign of contamination. In 1136,
Virus came.

A large vampire fleet, mostly consisting of ships from Kaegrogz and
Anghikh, barreled its way into Grnouf in 1136 after forays into Llaezgaen
and Vorvoun. Spies for the Protectorate returned with reports of carnage
all along the Grnouf Main. Taking a gamble, the Protectorate put the bulk
of its forces in Zargvaetsr, since it is the only Protectorate world
seperated by 2 parsecs to the Grnouf Main. It paid off.

The Vampire fleet jumped in 2 weeks after the Protectorate Navy had put
themselves into positions throughout the system. Despite being outnumbered,
the Protectorate Navy had the element of surprise and superior technology
on their side. They destroyed the bulk of the fleet as most of the ships
did not have the extra fuel to jump out of the system. Those that did, went
coreward into Ngathksirz sector. Protectorate casualties were moderate but
the naval base and Zargvaetsr itself were the unfortunate recipients of
suicide impacts from dying vampire ships.

Over the next two decades, several major battles were fought. The most
decisive came in 1156 when a large Vampire fleet tried invading the
Protectorate through its coreward jump 1 neighbors in Ngathksirz. This was
a successful maneuver. Although the Protectorate was patrolling these
worlds and received enough advance notice from their scouts, they did not
know which world the fleet was going to strike. Over a period of several
months, Vampire squadrons would jump in to a system, hit it, and jump back
out before the Vargr had a chance to strike. A few of these missions were
suicide runs designed to take out a starport or a naval base to soften up
the system before the larger force jumped in. The Protectorate was forced
to divide up its fleet among several worlds as most were within striking
distance. The entire Vampire fleet finally struck at Aertsvad. Defending
all 5 gas giants would have spread their forces too thin so only a few
ships had been sent to each gas giant. When the Vampire fleet jumped in,
the ships radioed the main fleet and then jumped to rejoin the main fleet.
Upon receiving the warning, couriers were sent out to warn their neighbors.
The battle, known as the Siege of Aertsvad, was fierce. Vargr fighter
pilots adopted the suicide tactics of the Vampires. The Vampire fleet
didn't consider the fighters much of a threat. This enabled the fighters to
within meters of them where they were able to detonate their nuclear
payloads. Casualties were heavy for both sides at Aertsvad but the Vargr
held their ground. The Vampire fleet was forced to flee.

With their coreward neighbors a liability, the Protectorate decided that it
would annex them. The Protectorate Recovery Program (PRP) began in 1158.
Advisors and troops were sent in to assess the situation of each of these
worlds and recommend the best course of action to bring these worlds back
to pre-Collapse levels. Although the work has been slow, definitive
progress has been made. All worlds in the Protectorate have at least a D
starport or better.

Virus brought out something unusual in the Vargr of the Lair Protectorate:
homeworld pride. Virus has been perceived as an attack on the Vargr way of
life. Virus has no charisma. The Vargr of the Protectorate feel greatly
insulted and, as such, will not suffer it. When dealing with Viral threats,
these Vargr fight with the tenacity of an Aslan defending the honor of his
clan and have not hesitated to lay down their lives in defense of the
Protectorate.

Other Subsector Notes:
The tech level for Anur (1706) in the UWP for 1120 is misleading. The
monarchy enjoyed the fruits of their subjects' labor. They imported high
tech goods from offworld while their subjects lived at tech level 7.
Working in the factories was mandatory. Conditions tended to be poor.
Dissidence was forbidden. The police made sure that the people remained in
line. Rebellion came when Virus sent the starport crashing down into the
capital city. As cities and industrial parks were being bombarded, the
people fled, often taking advantage of the confusion to attack local law
enforcement.

Uengva (2109), Saellok (2208), Arrunoer (2305), and Geksoen (2306) managed
to keep stripped down versions of their downports functional. All 4 worlds
lie on the Grnouf Main. While it is unknown why Vampires no longer make
their way down to the Uengva-Saellok arm, Geksoen's lack of gas giants
could be the reason why the Vampires don't travel down the Arrunoer-Geksoen
arm. They might be operating under the assumption that the starport is gone
from Geksoen, leaving only ocean refuelling as the means for leaving the
system. In either case, each pair of worlds has maintained light trade with
the other.

Tsaegag Subsector: The Tsaegag subsector has an estimated population in
1202 of approximately 936 million, a decline of 89% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Oekh Dal has the highest population (600 million) while
Khvhaergvaetsorrgh has the highest tech level rating (10). The Tsaegag
subsector had an estimated population in 1120 of approximately 8.5 billion.
Its highest population was 8 billion at Oekh Dal. Khvhaergvaetsorrgh had
the highest tech level (14).

Subsector Notes:
A backwater subsector of the Empire of Varroerth, the Tsaegag subsector
encountered less Vampire attacks than the average subsector. This was
probably due to the low stellar density in the area. While in many cases,
it only takes one attack to render catastrophic results (Gvoghaellthoe,
Kugk, Khok Ae, Uedh Kal) some worlds did not suffer greatly
(Khvhaergvaetsorrgh, Ugouksnge, Okhdzueg, and Tsaegag).

Khvhaergvaetsorrgh (2501) was one of the worlds that joined Lair (2402)
when it seceded from the Empire of Varroerth in 777.

Okhdzueg (2603) and Tsaegag (2604) continue to carry out a small amount of
trade with one another. Okhdzueg is an agricultural world while Tsaegag
conducts a limited amount of manufacturing. Although a huge market awaits
them at Oekh Dal (2706), they are fearful of accidentally encountering a
Viral egg.

Uedh Kal (3108), owned by the company of the same name, served as a reverse
engineering/research institute. Although only legally permitted to deal
with the Empire, the owners realized that a diversified client base was
much more preferrable. As such, they traded with regional governors in the
Empire as well as cosairs and other interstellar states. Being somewhat
remote, they were able to avoid getting hit with Virus for some time.
Expecting to be attacked by warships, a much needed supply ship did not
receive a thorough inspection. It contained an egg which, when hatched,
went right to the environmental controls. Whether or not it is still
present is unknown. Its remote location has been an inconvenience to
privateers.

Anghikh Subsector: The Anghikh Subsector has an estimated population in
1202 of approximately 146 million, a decline of 99.6% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Koudhgzaen has the highest population (90 million) while Nogh
has the highest tech level rating (9). The Anghikh subsector had an
estimated population in 1120 of approximately 35.1 billion. Its highest
population was 20 billion at Anghikhwhich also had the highest tech level
(15).

Subsector Notes:
Virus hit this subsector especially hard. The infected fleets from Kaegrogz
plowed through the area leaving death and destruction in their wake. Worlds
with organics were a scourge and needed to be reduced in numbers if not
completely eradicated.

Dhotsaeng (112) was ignored by the Kaegrogz Fleets. It is assumed that it
was too small a target. They have managed to keep their ships running by
occasionally foraging through the ruins of Ghoghzsorgh (212) for equipment.
With such a small gene pool (711 inhabitants in 1200), long term survival
will require an influx of fresh DNA. It is unaminously agreed that a more
aggressive search for other survivors is in order.

Nogh (119) is arguably the most intact world in the subsector (C starport
TL 9). Occasionally, a ship will travel to Zadz (120) to trade in a few
goods and raw materials but this is extremely limited as Zadz's starport
was destroyed and the tech level has been knocked down to 4. Nogh's other
neighbor, Oughdzak (219), was rendered lifeless.

At first, Rataetaenrar (216) suffered only moderate losses. The orbital
starport was destroyed but the downport remained intact. Recoverable tech
level, thanks to the forethought of the technocracy, was down to about 9.
After the Vampire attacks died down, a few ships were sent out to check the
status of Rataetaenrar's closest neighbors: Koudhgzaen (115), Uedzaell
(416), and the subsector capital, Anghikh (415). They found only
destruction. A second expedition was sent out to explore further but never
returned. All further explorations were cancelled. The technological
decline continued as society fragmented into numerous tribes. The starport
is run by a tribe of engineers and technicians who feel that it is their
purpose in life to keep it running for the day when starfarers return. In
the meantime, the knowledge is passed down from one generation to the next.

Anghikh (415) was a crown jewel in the former Empire of Varroerth. Like
Kaegrogz, they too were under orders to begin expansion. Corsairs in the
area were enlisted and encouraged to raid the rimward worlds to soften them
up. It was while the Anghikh fleet was amassing that Virus struck and
turned the big ships guns on the world below.

Uedzaell (416) always relied on outside support to keep their starport
going. When the supply ships stopped coming in, they began to run out of
replacement parts and materials. The downport lost its usefulness as it
became nothing more than just a large building with a large cement field.
The settlements continue to be near the North Pole, where moisture can be
collected during the long nights of winter. The "tainted" atmospheric
rating is due to the sandstorms which plague the planet.

The corsairs at Ughfangkhoeg (419) have become the "official" government of
their world. They've managed to keep the downport functional. A couple of
forays to Khaghdaeksong (418) have been helpful for spare parts.

Kaegrogz Subsector: The Kaegrogz Subsector has an estimated population in
1202 of approximately 7.2 billion, a decline of 65.9% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Anngang has the highest population (7 billion) while Aegh Rong
and Koenalor have the highest tech level rating (8). The Kaegrogz subsector
had an estimated population in 1120 of approximately 21.2 billion. Its
highest population was 8 billion at Anngang. Kaegrogz had the highest tech
level (14).

Subsector Notes:
Athoekhuerrg (915) was named after the company that owned it. Although the
law level of the world itself was low during the Rebellion, entrance to the
world was difficult. A band of corsairs helped to maintain security and
limit access. Information about the company and the work they did is
difficult to find. Rumors and speculations about the business conducted
there range from bioweapons to reverse engineering of Imperial technology.
Although the corsair base and all surface structures were destroyed, it is
not known whether or not the submerged facilities are still intact. With
the corsairs removed, there is nothing to stop an aggressive band of
privateers from investigating.

As the corsair outpost at Llurang (1013) began to thrive, it spawned
various service industries: Food, Entertainment, Healthcare, Starship
Maintenance, etc. Without any central authority to manage operations,
equity of services varied considerably. This is reflected in the tech level
6 rating for 1120. In some instances, available technology reached 9 and
even 10. With Virus eliminating off-world concerns, an effort has been made
to organize what's left (not much) and rebuild a more ordered society.

Bewildered by the ruins reaped upon Ghakong (1020) by Virus, the citizenry
lost hope. No one could decide what action to take to start the rebuilding
process and those few who tried, failed miserably. A group, calling
themselves the Zoloutsitsaekh, offered a plan of renewal but the price
would be to turn over the reins of government to them. Having encountered
nothing but failure, the people voted (by a 3:1 margin) to be ruled by the
Zoloutsitsaekh. Since coming to power, they have curtailed many personal
freedoms, including weapon ownership, yet haven't provided anything more
than meager infrastructure improvements and the appearance of order.
Although they have been strict, the Zoloutsitsaekh have not abused their
power.

The naval base at Ouksdzaenouk (1111) was completely surprised by a Vampire
fleet that was mostly composed of ships from the Empire (see Kaegrogz
below). Unable to muster up a defense fast enough, their forces were either
destroyed or infected in less than an hour. The starport and orbital cities
were pulverized. Ground cities were bombarded relentlessly. Nothing
remained that even remotely resembled civilization. Decades later, the
survivors have recovered enough to build towns and small cities but are
nowhere near their old tech level (currently a TL of 2). In the spirit of
rebuilding the world has been renamed Algoranong.

Koenalor (1116) and Lloedh (1217) were not hit too hard by Virus (For
Pre-Collapse history see Igzinghuell below). Granted both worlds had their
starports damaged, lost some ships, and had their infrastructure shaken
down, but for the most part they're intact. Each world at least has a
functioning starport (2 of the 4 in the subsector) and their tech levels (8
& 7 respectively) are such that they're able to maintain spaceflight
capable ships. The current dictator on Koenalor, Zoedhae Gvaenglang, has
instituted several reforms increasing personal freedoms for the people. On
Lloedh, the 23 nations agreed to be ruled a single leader whose job is to
make sure that cooperation exists on all possible levels between them.

Kaegrogz (1214) was a regional capital for the Empire of Varroerth. Several
corsairs were allowed to operate in the area on behalf of Kaegrogz and the
other Empire of Varroerth worlds. They teamed up with the Windhorn Alliance
for the raids on Corridor. They weren't above attacking other corsairs and
the Irrgh Manifest either. As a precursor to expansion for the Empire,
naval ships from Kaegrogz began to raid non-empire worlds in the rimward
half of the subsector in 1129. In 1135, despite warnings of the coming of
Virus, which was scoffed at as being an Imperial hoax, a naval squadron set
out for Igzinghuell (1316). They arrived in time to find the world already
under bombardment by the world's own navy (see Igzinghuell below). Although
hardened warriors themselves, they were nonetheless thrown off guard by
this sight. The Empire Builder strain of Virus in control of the
Igzinghuell navy quickly grabbed control of the Kaegrogz squadron. With
"juicier" targets lying spinward and coreward, the ships were refuelled and
sent back to Kaegrogz where they infected the rest of the Kaegrogz navy and
nuked the planet.

Igzinghuell (1316) was a world ruled by the Church of the Chosen Ones. They
initially enjoyed the support of the people as they truly had the welfare
of the people in mind. They reached TL 10 in 1109 and then decided to
spread the Word of the Church to others. Their first, and only, conquest
was Vifueks (1317) in 1115, which was renamed Igzinghuellstoul. Pleased by
their initial success, they set out to take Lloedh (1217) in 1118. They
were defeated by joint Lloedh and Koenalor (1117) forces. This joint force
went on to liberate Vifueks and then humble Igzinghuell. The naval base was
seriously damaged and the world was bombed from orbit. Rather than
finishing the job, the Lloedh-Koenalor task force returned home. The
humiliation angered the Church but the High Priest decided that perhaps a
path of peace was more appropriate. His popularity waned within the ranks
of the Akufar (the name of the body of high level clergy) who wanted
revenge. The High Priest was assassinated in 1120 by a bomb planted by the
Akufar, who in turn blamed it on terrorists backed by Lloedh and Koenalor.
The new High Priest avowed revenge. The Priesthood instituted extreme laws
and began a military buildup. Between 1125 - 1126, Igzinghuell's military
fought and eventually retook Igzinghuellstoul, whose natives had revolted
against the occupational government. From 1129 - 1135, the Igzinghuell navy
was forced to defend the homeworld from raiders (see Kaegrogz above), who
were hiding within the Empire of Varroerth, while trying to build up their
forces to go after Lloedh and Koenalor to exact a revenge that the public
was starting to lose interest in. The crushing blow came in 1135 when the
entire Igzinghuell navy became infected by an Empire Builder strain of
Virus. Those who managed to crawl out of the rubble felt that the
Priesthood had angered the gods and were punished. No known members of the
Priesthood are believed to have survived. The world has been renamed
Rousurgeks in an effort to start anew.

Vifueks (1317): (For pre-Collapse history see Igzinghuell above) Liberated
once and for all from Igzinghuell, the coming of Virus turned out to only
be a mixed blessing, rather than a horrible calamity. There was some damage
done to infrastructure and the starport but overall the Vargr of Vifueks
weathered Virus quite well. The starport still functions and a limited
amount of trade is conducted with its neighbors Lloedh and Koenalor.

Gveghz Subsector: The Gveghz Subsector has an estimated population in 1202
of approximately approximately 677 million, an decrease of 21% from its
Pre-Collapse population. Aeghvoekogz has the highest population (560
million) while Ongrro has the highest tech level rating (11). The Gveghz
Subsector had an estimated population in 1120 of approximately 857 million.
Aeghvoekogz had the highest population (765 million) and the highest tech
level (12).

Subsector Notes:
Most of this subsector lies within the Windhorn. Ongrro (1920) and
Togikhtsurzall (2211) have a 5 parsec cushion seperating them from the
ruins of Vargr space. In the past, this cushion hindered development. When
Vampire fleets came through the area, this gap became a security blanket
for them, Gegllurirse (2220), Farr (2319), and Naeztir (2920). These 5
worlds saw a brief influx of refugees and then nothing. Except for 2
occasions when Vampires jumped in at Ongrro (and were subsequently
destroyed), there has not been any contact with worlds outside of the
Windhorn.

The naval base at Ongrro remains intact. Most ships (75%) are stationed
here to defend Ongrro though some do patrol the other Windhorn worlds.
Realizing that they could not go it alone, the nation states of Ongrro have
been assisting Gegllurirse and Farr with their technological progress. It
has paid off as both worlds have taken big steps towards self-sufficient
navies.

The largest portion of Ongrro naval ships sent out on patrol go to
Togikhtsurzall. If it were attacked, it would not be able to defend itself.
The isolation of this world, even from the other Windhorn worlds, has
helped to perpetuate stagnation and decay within the infrastructure.
Originally, it served as a home for idealists who established a direct
democracy so that everyone's voice could be heard. It worked for a while
but soon social outcasts of a different sort (criminals pretending to be
victims of politics) wound up here. Their numbers quickly rose to become
the majority. As the crime rate rose, the idealists saw the writing on the
wall and moved on. Some wound up at Naeztir and decided to handle things
differently. After Virus "incapacitated" the civilized governments that had
declared them criminals, there was no longer any need to hide behind the
guise of political refugees. A vote was made to abolish the government
altogether. At first, there was no noticeable change but as resources
started to become scarce, violence returned.

Aeghvoekogz (1712) was the subject of an article entitled "Wolf Sport"
which appeared in Challenge issue #58. "It is a rich world typical of the
decaying Empire of Varroerth. Though its six independent nations (Aeghvoe,
Kogz, Gzargig, Vorkez, Nullu Vaer and Zoertsu Vaer) rarely agree on
anything, hostilities are extremely rare. The citizens of Aeghvoekogz seem
content with taking care of business matters and seeing to their own
personal entertainment. Because of Aeghvoekogz' long daylight and night
periods, each 60-hour day is broken up by five strictly controlled siestas
of five ours each, equally spaced throughout the day. It is a criminal
offense to work during these periods, and businesses (except essential
sevices) are mandated to completely cease operations during siestas."

Subsector Notes:
Naeztir (2920) lies a full 6 parsecs away from it's closest neighbor, Farr
(2319). Lying within the depths of the Windhorn, it has become a haven for
those seeking refuge from the tumultuousness of Vargr society. It is a
haven for political fugitives, religious heretics, hermits, and other
ideological misfits. Despite the fact that the ideologies of the refugees
range all over the spectrum, each group respects the others' rights to
sovereignty and access to the starport. During the Collapse, those seeking
to escape the reach of Virus began to arrive. Immigration alone has tripled
the world's population.

All new arrivals seeking to establish a homestead must apply for
citizenship, which is then voted upon by each of the nation states. The
process can take anywhere from 2 weeks to 3 months and helps to weed out
those whose "agenda" would directly interfere with the rights of other
nation states. In the meantime, applicants remain at the starport, which
lies within neutral territory.

Naeztir has continued to conduct an extremely limited amount of trade with
the worlds in the Uzasuen subsector. There is a communal pool of starships,
bolstered by the influx of refugees. These starships are maintained by the
Engineers Union and are loaned out on a first come, first serve basis. Only
25% of these ships are allowed out at a time and only the modified Jump 3
ships (gutted for double fuel tanks) at that. Being impractical to operate
on a commercial basis, they tend to only be used for important ventures.
The 4 remaining jump 6 ships are for emergency use only.

Dzarrvaer Subsector: The Dzarrvaer Subsector has an estimated population in
1202 of approximately 16 billion, a decline of 85.5% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Gnerang has the highest population (7 billion). Knokseng has
the highest tech level rating (10). The Dzarrvaer subsector had an
estimated population in 1120 of approximately 114 billion. Its highest
population was 60 billion at Tuerrg, which shared highest tech level honors
with Dzarrvaer (15).

KV allegiance code impact upon government code in UWP:
 0 Anarchy
 1 Tribal Government
 2 Direct Democracy
 3 Charismatic Dictatorship (Low Law Level tendencies)
 4 Representative Democracy
 5 Technocratic Oligarchy
 6 Technologically Elevated Dictator (Law Level DM corresponds accordingly)
 7 Balkanization (no clear "leading" nation)
 8 Charismatic Dictatorship (High Law Level tendencies)
 9 Charismatic Oligarchy
 A Civil Service Bureaucracy
 B Self-Perpetuating Oligarchy
 C Impersonal Bureaucracy
 D Religious/Mystic Dictatorship/Autocracy (any of 4 possible combinations)

The dual appearance of Charismatic Dictatorship reflects the local Vargr
preference to follow governments of this type.

B in the PPG column continues to stand for Balkanized.

Subsector Notes:
The home of the Dzarrgh Federate during the last decades of the Third
Imperium, this subsector enjoyed prosperity through trade with its
neighboring states and the Imperium itself. When the Rebellion broke out
and the Corridor fleet was removed, the Vargr interpreted this as a sign of
weakness. Greed overcame them and their neighbors. They drove rimward and
began their plunder of Corridor. Imperial booty was hauled back home and
prosperity continued in a different way. This greed was their undoing as
the raiders brought back infected equipment and ships. Virus consumed these
worlds just as these worlds had consumed the Imperial worlds in Corridor.

Amazingly enough, many worlds in this subsector fought successfully against
Virus. Although 100 billion Vargr died, the population today is over 16
billion. 12 worlds have functional starports. After a couple of decades of
defending their homeworlds, these worlds, isolated from the next by no more
than 2 parsecs began to cooperate with one another. In the spirit of the
old Dzarrgh Federate, a new interstellar state was formed, the Knokseng
Confederation.

The Knokseng Confederation isn't much more that a support group in the year
1202. Member worlds trade with one another and share in the patrol duties,
ever alert for possible Vampire fleets. The links between these worlds is
tenuous at best. A patrol even monitors the dead Kas (627) system in case
any Vampire ships attempt to refuel at the gas giants.

A critical juncture in this chain lies at Oksruenvae (526). This world is
the coreward link to the rimward portion of the chain. It lies 2 parsecs
away from both Oth Uegaen (325) and Gvae (624). If it were to fall, the
rimward chain would be seperated from the coreward portion by 3 parsecs.
Ships that can make that leap are even fewer in supply than the Jump 2
ships. For this reason, the oppressive T.E.D. in command of this world is
tolerated. The Knokseng Confederation maintains a non-interference policy.
So long as the T.E.D. keeps the starport open and doesn't attack any
off-worlders, they'll leave him alone. There are several factions that war
on and off with the T.E.D. but none has been successful enough in defeating
him.

Knunguegaegn (421), an industrial world, was run by a conservative
(detractors say rigid) council which believed that strict discipline was
the proper way to run their world and the workplace. For a time, it was
successful and the council enjoyed the overwhelming confidence of its
citizens, who enjoyed prosperity. Virus changed all that. Millions died
during the initial onslaught and subsequent attacks in the years to come.
The government was able to maintain control for many years due to the fact
that the populace had come to trust its judgement. When food became scarce
and millions more died from starvation, an insurrection took place.
Millions more died during the struggle. Eventually, the rebels were won.
The world was renamed Okhskhun. With a billion dead, the great industrial
complexes silent, and environmental toxins neutralized, the relatively few
(9 million as opposed to 1 billion) survivors felt like they were on a
completely different world.

Dzarrvaer (225) was the capital of the Dzarrgh Federate, a successful,
though short-lived, interstellar state. 95% of the 20 billion plus populace
died when Virus ran amok. Dzarrvaer's technological superiority (TL-15)
made for a fertile environment in which Virus could bloom. At first, grav
cities crashed, infected ships bombed the world, and vehicles hunted down
pedestrians. The survivors, the small fraction living outside of major
urban areas, went to war with the Vampires. After several decades, the last
of the Vampire machinery was defeated. The old cities are still shunned.
The Vargr won't rule out the possibility that something may still be
lurking there. Before these cities can be reclaimed, or scrapped, the Vargr
need to regather their strength.

Contact with representatives of the Knokseng Confederation has gone well.
It is likely that in a few years, Dzarrvaer will be ready to join the
Knokseng Confederation. It will be a long time, if ever, before they are
able to return to their former glory.

Future Plans of the Knokseng Confederation:

  1. Scout out and survey an area of 5 parsecs in all directions and look
     for survivors and reestablish contact with them.
  2. Invite recovered worlds (those still not heavily infested with Virus)
     into the Confederation, i.e. Dzarrvaer.
  3. Establish a permanent presence at Kas to support area patrols.
  4. Upgrade infrastructure and education of current member worlds to TL-8,
     9, & 10.
  5. Upgrade all starports to at least a "C" rating.

Aenkuk Subsector: The Aenkuk Subsector has an estimated population in 1202
of approximately 10.5 billion, a decline of 87.3% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Foedargh has the highest population (8 billion). 3 worlds share
the highest tech level rating (7): Naetsarraluz, Ezksog, and Llokhaegueg.
The Aenkuk subsector had an estimated population in 1120 of approximately
83 billion. Its highest population was 20 billion at Naetsarraluz, Aenkuk
and Tuegu. Aenkuk had the highest tech level honors (15).

Subsector Notes:
The Aenkuk subsector has been dominated by the Irrgh Manifest for
centuries. Although the boundaries of this state has waxed and waned
through the years, it has steadfastedly held the majority of the worlds in
this subsector. Virus succeeded in loosening that grip.

Little interstellar trade continues today. Only Nokoegz (1224), Llokhaegueg
(1226), Nurrok (1424), and Ezksog (1525) are able to maintain enough ships
to continue trade. The starports are considered neutral territory on
Nokoegz and Llokhaegueg. Off-worlders should exercise caution on these 2
worlds. The nation states of these worlds are desperately trying to hold
onto what remaining bits of technology they can scrounge and will not
hesitate to attack a perceived weakness.

A local chapter of the Church of the Chosen Ones has come to power on Tuegu
(1028). Before the Collapse, the Church held little power. With the dozen
nation-states humbled, the Church began to preach that an era of rebirth
and spirituality had begun. "The sinners have been punished and it is now
time for the Church to guide our lives." Tens of millions of Vargr were
swayed and have joined the Church. Sufficiently strong, the Church has
announced that a Crusade will begin to convert the whole world. Those that
will not convert will be slain. Needless to say, the remnants of the
nation-states are not too pleased by this proclamation.

Aenkuk (1328), an industrial, high tech world (15), was the subsector
capital for the Irrgh Manifest since its beginning. A suicider strain of
Virus brought it all crashing down. Orbiting cities spaced their
inhabitants and plummeted to the world below. The cities on the ground
became death traps in their own right as everything with a computer chip in
it ran amok. To this day, they are still shunned.

The Church of the Chosen Ones ruled Foedargh (1522) with an iron fist. None
dared to oppose the Church. Off-worlders who were found to be participating
in activities that countermanded the Church were arrested. The people did
not get to enjoy the fruits of their labors (hence TL5). The commodities
they manufactured were exported. Profits were used to build great temples
and equipment and weapons that strengthened the Church's control. There
wasn't much for Virus to infect here. The starport was knocked out of
commission along with the few high tech devices the Church imported. In
remote regions, insurrectionists have broken free of the Church's grip.
Civil war continues to this day.

The various nations of Ezksog (1525) put aside their differences and formed
a world government to pick up the pieces after Virus. The starport remains
open in neutral territory and technology is shared equally between nations.

The downport at Uznukhozots (1527) was not destroyed when Virus hit this
world. However, it has broken down due to lack of maintenance. It lies idle
and abandoned as the inhabitants have wandered elsewhere.

Naetsarraluz (1629) was a prosperous, high tech, industrial world in the
Irrgh Manifest. This made it fertile ground for Virus to take root. It has
thrived. The UWP stats listed are for the surviving Vargr. For decades, the
great industrial complexes of the various nations, churned out robots whose
sole purpose was to exterminate Vargr. After wiping out over 99.9% of the
population, the killing stopped. The "Machine" was satisfied that the
remaining Vargr were no longer a threat and switched its focus to building
starships for itself. This decision may have been a bit hasty. Although the
Vargr survivors have put the cease fire to good use by building a
successful agricultural base, they have not given up on revenge.

Karrdzae Subsector: The Karrdzae Subsector has an estimated population in
1202 of approximately 21 million, a decline of 99.9% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Karrdzae has the highest population (20 million). The highest
tech level rating (7) belongs to the Droyne on Oudzkharz. The Karrdzae
Subsector had an estimated population in 1120 of approximately 40 billion.
Its highest population was 40 billion at Karrdzae, which also had the
highest tech level (12).

Subsector Notes:
Karrdzae (1729), like Naetsarraluz (1629), was a prosperous, high tech,
industrial world in the Irrgh Manifest. It shared a similar fate.

The Droyne on Oudzkharz (1828) were kept confined to 1 small continent by
the Vargr. Having no starships of their own. All offworld contact was
through the Vargr. Besides their physical isolation, the Droyne
infrastructure was isolated from the Vargr as well. The Droyne also did not
share the same technological level (7 as opposed to 11) as the Vargr.
Despite this, interracial relations were fairly good. There was even a fair
amount of trade. All that changed when Virus hit. As a result of those
factors, the Droyne computer systems were spared from infection. The Vargr
survivors mistook this to mean that the Droyne were somehow allied with
Virus and declared war. The Vargr caught the Droyne offguard at first but
they soon recovered. After several years of brutal warfare, the few Vargr
remaining surrendered. They were forced to leave their irradiated homelands
and were exiled to a remote, yet sizable, island chain. Their numbers today
hover around 30,000. The Droyne have advanced to TL 9 and have a small
space program.

Subsector Notes:
Dhorue and Kaerfoz were more populous before the Rebellion started.
Millions of Vargr emigrated to member worlds of the Windhorn Alliance to
get a "piece of the action." Those that stayed behind missed out on the
spoils that the raiders grabbed. They also missed out on the ravages that
Virus brought to those worlds as well. News of the carnage has leaked in
through Vozoekeng (2832), which managed to avoid getting the full brunt of
Virus.

A very small amount of trade continues between these worlds and Vozoekeng.
Due to the scarcity of jump 4 ships, most ships carry drop tanks or
collapsible fuel tanks in order to make the long journey between worlds.
The patrols at Dhorue are quite thorough in examining ships for possible
Viral contamination. They realize that one mistake means death for their
world. Both worlds have also seen population increases due to immigration
as well as through natural reproduction.

Lighoz Subsector: The Lighoz Subsector has an estimated population in 1202
of approximately 10.0 billion, a decline of 86.5% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Ug Kanek has the highest population (6 billion). Lighoz has the
highest tech level rating (9). The Lighoz subsector had an estimated
population in 1120 of approximately 74.2 billion. Its highest population
was 50 billion at Arerzthoe, and its highest tech level was 13 at Uedtzon
and Kirg.

Subsector Notes:
The large number of asteroid belts in otherwise habitable zones in a few
systems (Dzaegzaek, Anthonkfoers, Aenggvug, Gingrue, Aeghzisung and
Orgukung in Voudzeur subsector) has led Vargr researchers to conclude that
these worlds were once whole. They believe that these worlds were destroyed
during the War of the Ancients. No evidence has yet been found to back up
this claim.

Virus hit this subsector hard and the Vargr themselves are partly to blame.
The eagerness of the Dzarrgh Federate, Irrgh Manifest, and numerous corsair
groups to plunder the undefended Corridor and weakened Imperium was their
own undoing. Infected ships and systems would return to their bases and
starports and unwittingly spread the contagion to their comrades and
allies. Only 1 (Lighoz) of the 28 systems in this subsector still has
anything resembling a functional starport by 1202.

Despite 7 billion deaths, Lighoz (335) has managed to survive. A
benevolent, yet mystic, dictator, Tongkaeng, has united the survivors and
managed to inspire them to preserve as much of their old way of life as
possible. It has worked. As noted above, Lighoz has the one functional
starport (C) and highest tech level (9) in the subsector.

The infected machinery on Thueni (632) are intent upon eradicating all
other sentient life. A shipment of robots, en route to the naval base from
Arerzthoe (634), was diverted to the planet just as the naval base was
committing suicide. Although activated to defend the planet, these robots
turned on their owners. With only a handful of Vargr left, it would appear
that these robots will soon accomplish their goal.

Arerzthoe continues to be a mess. 47 billion have died from the
technological collapse, orbital bombardment from infected ships, and
warfare amongst the survivors for the remaining scraps. The amount of dust
and radiation still present in the atmosphere accounts for the tainted
rating for its 1202 UWP.

In 1119, Kirg (831) was the site of treaty of non-aggression between the
Dzarrgh Federate and the Irrgh Manifest (Vilani & Vargr pg.53). This treaty
enabled each state to focus on plundering Corridor rather than having to
waste resources worrying about the other.

Subsector Notes:
Virus hit this subsector hard and the Vargr themselves are partly to blame.
The eagerness of the Irrgh Manifest, Glory of Taarskoerzn, and numerous
corsair groups to plunder the undefended Corridor and weakened Imperium was
their own undoing. Infected ships and systems would return to their bases
and starports and unwittingly spread the contagion to their comrades and
allies. Only 2 (Okfae & Thoelksor) of the 23 systems in this subsector
still has anything resembling a functional starport by 1202.

Oruzoefu (931) was being run by the Irrgh Manifest navy after it had been
captured from the Dzarrgh Federate during their brief scuffle prior to the
Treaty of Kirg ("Vilani & Vargr" pg53). After Virus scuttled the occupying
naval forces, a branch of the Church of the Chosen Ones slowly came to
power. Their rule has been strict.

Okfae (937) managed to salvage enough technology, due to the government's
steadfast belief in preserving it, to keep their starport functional.

Over 9 billion people perished on Voudzeur (1039). Being a waterworld,
there wasn't much land for the Vargr to build on. Through the wonders of
technology (TL15) they were able to build great cities in orbit and above
the surface of the waters. When Virus struck, cities in orbit plummeted to
the world below. Cities floating above the waters sank, drowning their
denizens. Today, the survivors live primitively on the many island chains
which dot the globe. A brave few have chosen to live on the ruined hulks of
those cities that jut out from the shallower water. Most view these places
as haunted and shun them.

Thoelksor (1331) has their new leader, Grrak, to thank for their starport.
While the elected representatives debated about what course of action to
follow, Verrok, Grrak's father, organized the technical guilds into putting
the pieces together. Although he died before he could see the starport
functional again, Grrak has finished the work his father started. The
people were so pleased that they abandoned the government, without
bloodshed, and made him their leader.

Igunfaksa (1431) was once the capital of the Irrgh Manifest. It was their
leaders' hope that after successfully plundering Corridor, they would have
enough firepower to vanquish the Glory of Taarsokoerzn and their allies and
reunite with the trailing portion of their divided state. Before this could
be accomplished, Virus struck. A billion people died and the survivors have
divided into dozens of states.

The oppressive bureaucrats at Kfueghoeror (1433) were killed in a bloody
coup once their support structure collapsed. The world has been renamed
Gvaedzueth by the people in order to sever any associations with the
preceding rulers of their world.

Uekhourg Subsector: The Uekhourg Subsector has an estimated population in
1202 of approximately 4.76 billion, a decline of 94.6% from its
Pre-Collapse population. Taarskoerzn has the highest population (3
billion). Gvalur has the highest tech level rating (9). The subsector had
an estimated population in 1120 of approximately 87.5 billion. Uekhourg had
the highest population (70 billion) and shared the highest tech level (13)
with Khungorr.

Subsector Notes:
Virus hit this subsector hard and the Vargr themselves are partly to blame.
The eagerness of the Irrgh Manifest, Glory of Taarskoerzn, and numerous
corsair groups to plunder the undefended Corridor and weakened Imperium was
their own undoing. Infected ships and systems would return to their bases
and starports and unwittingly spread the contagion to their comrades and
allies. Only 1 (Gvalur) of the 21 systems in this subsector still has
anything resembling a functional starport by 1202.

Taarskoerzn (1835) was the capital of the Glory of Taarskoerzn, a state
which only consisted of 7 member worlds prior to 1116. Jealous of their
rivals, the Irrgh Manifest, they enlisted the aid of corsairs to go against
them. The Church of the Chosen Ones provided moral support to their cause.
In 1116, they plowed their way into Corridor, splitting the Irrgh Manifest
in two. Riding high on their success, they began plotting the next phase of
their expansion. They were caught by surprise when a united fleet of
corsairs overwhelmed Depot. As a result, they soon found themselves taking
orders rather then giving them. (Vilani & Vargr pg.53-54)

The next blow to Taarskoerzn came from Virus. Two billion people died as
the world was thrown into chaos. Emerging from this chaos was the Church.
Feeling betrayed by what they saw as self-serving pompousness, they turned
on the government seeking to punish them for what befell their world. They
have been merciless. They now dominate most of the planet. A few splinter
groups are trying to resist the Church, claiming that the world has
suffered enough and it is now time to heal. Offworlders should exercise
extreme caution when visiting Taarskoerzn. The Church will not hesitate to
blame offworlders for the current plight of their world.

A TED has come to power on Khvusu (1933). He blames the fall of his world
upon a perceived lack of security and law enforcement and extravagant
personal freedom. With the backing of the Church of the Chosen Ones, he and
his henchmen have sought to put order back into society. Offworlders should
exercise extreme caution when visiting Khvusu. The TED will not hesitate to
accuse them of introducing perverse ideas to society.

Uedzoghaeg (2131) was named after the ruler of the world. He lost
popularity with the citizenry when he failed to unite himself with the
Glory of Taarskoerzn. Too strong to overthrow, he remained in power. He was
present at the starport when Virus struck and died when it plummeted to the
world below. Thinking it was just a prelude to invasion by Taarskoerzn
forces, a new government formed and the citizenry voted to rename the
world, Kfaegh. No invaders have ever come. Succeeding generations of Vargr
have kept the name but not the desire to join the Glory.

The relative isolation of Gvalur (2332) has helped it to weather the storm
that is Virus. Lying just inside Windhorn Rift, it received few attacks.
Their society has remained intact as has their government. As a result,
they've been able to maintain a tech level of 9. It is also the site of the
one functional starport in this subsector.

Uekhourg (2437) has suffered terribly from Virus. The computerized assembly
lines of this industrialized world turned into slaughterhouses. Those not
killed outright from the technological collapse were rounded up by vampire
robots and vehicles and herded like cattle into the machinery. Offworlders
should exercise extreme caution when visiting Uekhourg. The Kfurr Ugae,
"killing machine" in the Gvegh Vargr dialect, does not care what feeds it.

Daekvagul Subsector: The Daekvagul Subsector has an estimated population in
1202 of approximately 14.7 billion, a decline of 84.9% from its
Pre-Collapse population. Theksas has the highest population (8 billion).
Vozoekeng has the highest tech level rating (8). The Daekvagul subsector
had an estimated population in 1120 of approximately 97.1 billion.
Daekvagul had the highest population (80 billion) and the highest tech
level (13).

Subsector Notes:
Virus hit this subsector hard and the Vargr themselves are partly to blame.
The eagerness of the Irrgh Manifest and numerous corsair groups to plunder
the undefended Corridor and weakened Imperium was their own undoing.
Infected ships and systems would return to their bases and starports and
unwittingly spread the contagion to their comrades and allies. Only 1
(Vozoekeng) of the 19 systems in this subsector still has anything
resembling a functional starport by 1202.

Approximately 75 billion people died on Daekvagul (2540) as a result of
Virus contaminated equipment. The carnage was so great that the world
received a "tainted" atmospheric rating for a few decades. Cities in orbit
spaced their inhabitants and plunged to the world below while cities
hovering over the oceans sank. Legends among the survivors tell of these
cities engaging in Oukskfalok, the Vargr equivalent of jousting or
"chicken" in Anglic slang. In a few spots, several cities piled up to form
artificial islands. Eventually, the submerged portions were colonized by
coral organisms. Other aquatic and avian species then began to make their
homes in and on these islands. Pursuing the supply of game, many people
have abandoned the mainland and surrounding natural islands for these new
habitats.

Due to its relative isolation in the Windhorn Rift, Vozoekeng (2832),
managed to survive Virus relatively intact. It has the sole functional
starport and the highest tech level in 1202. They plan on sending out
scouting parties soon to look for survivors and relics.

Garogag (2839) was a balkanized world for centuries. Priests from the
Church of the Chosen Ones somehow managed to unite the people under a
single government, them. They were fairly strict and after a couple of
decades prohibited viewpoints that disagreed with the Church. Virus was
more than the Church could handle. A self-proclaimed atheist TED has arose
during the chaos and quickly took advantage of the situation. Although the
Church still rules a portion of the world, along with a few other splinter
groups, they no longer dominate.

Thuezou (2840) is in the process or rebuilding a starport. They will have
an E by the end of 1202 partly due to cooperation with the Human
population. By treaty signed in 1033, a human colony on a remote sub-arctic
island was tolerated by the Vargr majority. Very little interaction took
place beyond trading. When the Irrgh Manifest began raiding the Imperium,
the humans here could do nothing but watch. In the aftermath of Virus,
Vargr-Human interaction increased. In 1187, as a gesture of goodwill, the
newly formed Vargr government granted representation to the human
population.

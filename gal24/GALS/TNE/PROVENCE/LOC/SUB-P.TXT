Subsector Notes:

Virus hit this subsector hard and the Vargr themselves are partly to blame.
The eagerness of the Irrgh Manifest and numerous corsair groups to plunder
the undefended Corridor and weakened Imperium was their own undoing.
Infected ships and systems would return to their bases and starports and
unwittingly spread the contagion to their comrades and allies. Only 1
(Vozoekeng) of the 19 systems in this subsector still has anything
resembling a functional starport by 1202.


Dzarrvaer (225) was the capital of the Dzarrgh Federate, a successful,
though short-lived, interstellar state. 95% of the 20 billion plus populace
died when Virus ran amok. Dzarrvaer's technological superiority (TL-15)
made for a fertile environment in which Virus could bloom. At first, grav
cities crashed, infected ships bombed the world, and vehicles hunted down
pedestrians. The survivors, the small fraction living outside of major
urban areas, went to war with the Vampires. After several decades, the last
of the Vampire machinery was defeated. The old cities are still shunned.
The Vargr won't rule out the possibility that something may still be
lurking there. Before these cities can be reclaimed, or scrapped, the Vargr
need to regather their strength.

Contact with representatives of the Knokseng Confederation has gone well.
It is likely that in a few years, Dzarrvaer will be ready to join the
Knokseng Confederation. It will be a long time, if ever, before they are
able to return to their former glory.

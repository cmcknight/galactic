
Thoelksor (1331) has their new leader, Grrak, to thank for their starport.
While the elected representatives debated about what course of action to
follow, Verrok, Grrak's father, organized the technical guilds into putting
the pieces together. Although he died before he could see the starport
functional again, Grrak has finished the work his father started. The
people were so pleased that they abandoned the government, without
bloodshed, and made him their leader.

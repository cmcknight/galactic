
The infected machinery on Thueni (632) are intent upon eradicating all
other sentient life. A shipment of robots, en route to the naval base from
Arerzthoe (634), was diverted to the planet just as the naval base was
committing suicide. Although activated to defend the planet, these robots
turned on their owners. With only a handful of Vargr left, it would appear
that these robots will soon accomplish their goal.


Naetsarraluz (1629) was a prosperous, high tech, industrial world in the
Irrgh Manifest. This made it fertile ground for Virus to take root. It has
thrived. The UWP stats listed are for the surviving Vargr. For decades, the
great industrial complexes of the various nations, churned out robots whose
sole purpose was to exterminate Vargr. After wiping out over 99.9% of the
population, the killing stopped. The "Machine" was satisfied that the
remaining Vargr were no longer a threat and switched its focus to building
starships for itself. This decision may have been a bit hasty. Although the
Vargr survivors have put the cease fire to good use by building a
successful agricultural base, they have not given up on revenge.

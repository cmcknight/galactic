
Gunog (1405), formerly known as Ksarthangtsouts, was once run by a
restrictive, almost stifling bureaucracy. In an effort to preserve some
semblance of unity after the capital city sank, the surviving government
officials drafted up several reforms. Each island was permitted to rule
itself so long as those rules did not conflict with rules established by
the world government. Representatives from the islands convene to run the
world government. As noted by the drastic difference in pre and
post-Collapse law levels, there has been very little legislation enacted to
curb the islands' freedom. As such, it has allowed the islands a chance to
concentrate on rebuilding. So far, the inhabitants have not abused their
new level of freedom.


Athoekhuerrg (915) was named after the company that owned it. Although the
law level of the world itself was low during the Rebellion, entrance to the
world was difficult. A band of corsairs helped to maintain security and
limit access. Information about the company and the work they did is
difficult to find. Rumors and speculations about the business conducted
there range from bioweapons to reverse engineering of Imperial technology.
Although the corsair base and all surface structures were destroyed, it is
not known whether or not the submerged facilities are still intact. With
the corsairs removed, there is nothing to stop an aggressive band of
privateers from investigating.

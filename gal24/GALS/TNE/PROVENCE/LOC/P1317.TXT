
Vifueks (1317): (For pre-Collapse history see Igzinghuell above) Liberated
once and for all from Igzinghuell, the coming of Virus turned out to only
be a mixed blessing, rather than a horrible calamity. There was some damage
done to infrastructure and the starport but overall the Vargr of Vifueks
weathered Virus quite well. The starport still functions and a limited
amount of trade is conducted with its neighbors Lloedh and Koenalor.

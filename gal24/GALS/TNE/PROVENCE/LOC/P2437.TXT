
Uekhourg (2437) has suffered terribly from Virus. The computerized assembly
lines of this industrialized world turned into slaughterhouses. Those not
killed outright from the technological collapse were rounded up by vampire
robots and vehicles and herded like cattle into the machinery. Offworlders
should exercise extreme caution when visiting Uekhourg. The Kfurr Ugae,
"killing machine" in the Gvegh Vargr dialect, does not care what feeds it.

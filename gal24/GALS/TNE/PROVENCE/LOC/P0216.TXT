
At first, Rataetaenrar (216) suffered only moderate losses. The orbital
starport was destroyed but the downport remained intact. Recoverable tech
level, thanks to the forethought of the technocracy, was down to about 9.
After the Vampire attacks died down, a few ships were sent out to check the
status of Rataetaenrar's closest neighbors: Koudhgzaen (115), Uedzaell
(416), and the subsector capital, Anghikh (415). They found only
destruction. A second expedition was sent out to explore further but never
returned. All further explorations were cancelled. The technological
decline continued as society fragmented into numerous tribes. The starport
is run by a tribe of engineers and technicians who feel that it is their
purpose in life to keep it running for the day when starfarers return. In
the meantime, the knowledge is passed down from one generation to the next.

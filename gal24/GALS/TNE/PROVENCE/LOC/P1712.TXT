
Aeghvoekogz (1712) was the subject of an article entitled "Wolf Sport"
which appeared in Challenge issue #58. "It is a rich world typical of the
decaying Empire of Varroerth. Though its six independent nations (Aeghvoe,
Kogz, Gzargig, Vorkez, Nullu Vaer and Zoertsu Vaer) rarely agree on
anything, hostilities are extremely rare. The citizens of Aeghvoekogz seem
content with taking care of business matters and seeing to their own
personal entertainment. Because of Aeghvoekogz' long daylight and night
periods, each 60-hour day is broken up by five strictly controlled siestas
of five ours each, equally spaced throughout the day. It is a criminal
offense to work during these periods, and businesses (except essential
sevices) are mandated to completely cease operations during siestas."

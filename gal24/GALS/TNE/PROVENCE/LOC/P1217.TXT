starport damaged, lost some ships, and had its infrastructure shaken down,
but for the most part it's intact and still with a functional starport
as well the ability to maintain spaceflight capable ships. The 23 nations
of Lloedh agreed to be ruled a single leader whose job is to make sure
that cooperation exists on all possible levels between them.

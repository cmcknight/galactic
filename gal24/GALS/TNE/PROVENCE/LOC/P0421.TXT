
Knunguegaegn (421), an industrial world, was run by a conservative
(detractors say rigid) council which believed that strict discipline was
the proper way to run their world and the workplace. For a time, it was
successful and the council enjoyed the overwhelming confidence of its
citizens, who enjoyed prosperity. Virus changed all that. Millions died
during the initial onslaught and subsequent attacks in the years to come.
The government was able to maintain control for many years due to the fact
that the populace had come to trust its judgement. When food became scarce
and millions more died from starvation, an insurrection took place.
Millions more died during the struggle. Eventually, the rebels were won.
The world was renamed Okhskhun. With a billion dead, the great industrial
complexes silent, and environmental toxins neutralized, the relatively few
(9 million as opposed to 1 billion) survivors felt like they were on a
completely different world.

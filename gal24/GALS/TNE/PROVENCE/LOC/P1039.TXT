
Over 9 billion people perished on Voudzeur (1039). Being a waterworld,
there wasn't much land for the Vargr to build on. Through the wonders of
technology (TL15) they were able to build great cities in orbit and above
the surface of the waters. When Virus struck, cities in orbit plummeted to
the world below. Cities floating above the waters sank, drowning their
denizens. Today, the survivors live primitively on the many island chains
which dot the globe. A brave few have chosen to live on the ruined hulks of
those cities that jut out from the shallower water. Most view these places
as haunted and shun them.

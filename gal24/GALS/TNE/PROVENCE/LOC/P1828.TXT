
The Droyne on Oudzkharz (1828) were kept confined to 1 small continent by
the Vargr. Having no starships of their own, all offworld contact was
through the Vargr. Besides their physical isolation, the Droyne
infrastructure was isolated from the Vargr as well. The Droyne also did not
share the same technological level (7 as opposed to 11) as the Vargr.
Despite this, interracial relations were fairly good. There was even a fair
amount of trade. All that changed when Virus hit. As a result of those
factors, the Droyne computer systems were spared from infection. The Vargr
survivors mistook this to mean that the Droyne were somehow allied with
Virus and declared war. The Vargr caught the Droyne offguard at first but
they soon recovered. After several years of brutal warfare, the few Vargr
remaining surrendered. They were forced to leave their irradiated homelands
and were exiled to a remote, yet sizable, island chain. Their numbers today
hover around 30,000. The Droyne have advanced to TL 9 and have a small
space program.

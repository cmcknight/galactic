
The naval base at Ouksdzaenouk (1111) was completely surprised by a Vampire
fleet that was mostly composed of ships from the Empire (see Kaegrogz
below). Unable to muster up a defense fast enough, their forces were either
destroyed or infected in less than an hour. The starport and orbital cities
were pulverized. Ground cities were bombarded relentlessly. Nothing
remained that even remotely resembled civilization. Decades later, the
survivors have recovered enough to build towns and small cities but are
nowhere near their old tech level (currently a TL of 2). In the spirit of
rebuilding the world has been renamed Algoranong.

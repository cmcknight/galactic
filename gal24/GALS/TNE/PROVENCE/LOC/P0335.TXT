
Despite 7 billion deaths, Lighoz (335) has managed to survive. A
benevolent, yet mystic, dictator, Tongkaeng, has united the survivors and
managed to inspire them to preserve as much of their old way of life as
possible. It has worked. As noted above, Lighoz has the one functional
starport (C) and highest tech level (9) in the subsector.

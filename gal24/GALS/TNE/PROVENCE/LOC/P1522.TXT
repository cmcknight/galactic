
The Church of the Chosen Ones ruled Foedargh (1522) with an iron fist. None
dared to oppose the Church. Off-worlders who were found to be participating
in activities that countermanded the Church were arrested. The people did
not get to enjoy the fruits of their labors (hence TL5). The commodities
they manufactured were exported. Profits were used to build great temples
and equipment and weapons that strengthened the Church's control. There
wasn't much for Virus to infect here. The starport was knocked out of
commission along with the few high tech devices the Church imported. In
remote regions, insurrectionists have broken free of the Church's grip.
Civil war continues to this day.

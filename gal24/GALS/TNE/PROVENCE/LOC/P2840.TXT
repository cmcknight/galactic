
Thuezou (2840) is in the process or rebuilding a starport. They will have
an E by the end of 1202 partly due to cooperation with the Human
population. By treaty signed in 1033, a human colony on a remote sub-arctic
island was tolerated by the Vargr majority. Very little interaction took
place beyond trading. When the Irrgh Manifest began raiding the Imperium,
the humans here could do nothing but watch. In the aftermath of Virus,
Vargr-Human interaction increased. In 1187, as a gesture of goodwill, the
newly formed Vargr government granted representation to the human
population.

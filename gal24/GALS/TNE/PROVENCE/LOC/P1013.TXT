
As the corsair outpost at Llurang (1013) began to thrive, it spawned
various service industries: Food, Entertainment, Healthcare, Starship
Maintenance, etc. Without any central authority to manage operations,
equity of services varied considerably. This is reflected in the tech level
6 rating for 1120. In some instances, available technology reached 9 and
even 10. With Virus eliminating off-world concerns, an effort has been made
to organize what's left (not much) and rebuild a more ordered society.

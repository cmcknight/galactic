Subsector Notes:

A backwater subsector of the Empire of Varroerth, the Tsaegag subsector
encountered less Vampire attacks than the average subsector. This was
probably due to the low stellar density in the area. While in many cases,
it only takes one attack to render catastrophic results (Gvoghaellthoe,
Kugk, Khok Ae, Uedh Kal) some worlds did not suffer greatly
(Khvhaergvaetsorrgh, Ugouksnge, Okhdzueg, and Tsaegag).

Khvhaergvaetsorrgh (2501) was one of the worlds that joined Lair (2402)
when it seceded from the Empire of Varroerth in 777.

Okhdzueg (2603) and Tsaegag (2604) continue to carry out a small amount of
trade with one another. Okhdzueg is an agricultural world while Tsaegag
conducts a limited amount of manufacturing. Although a huge market awaits
them at Oekh Dal (2706), they are fearful of accidentally encountering a
Viral egg.

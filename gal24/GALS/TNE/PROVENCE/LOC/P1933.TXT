
A TED has come to power on Khvusu (1933). He blames the fall of his world
upon a perceived lack of security and law enforcement and extravagant
personal freedom. With the backing of the Church of the Chosen Ones, he and
his henchmen have sought to put order back into society. Offworlders should
exercise extreme caution when visiting Khvusu. The TED will not hesitate to
accuse them of introducing perverse ideas to society.


Subsector Notes:

Dhorue and Kaerfoz were more populous before the Rebellion started.
Millions of Vargr emigrated to member worlds of the Windhorn Alliance to
get a "piece of the action." Those that stayed behind missed out on the
spoils that the raiders grabbed. They also missed out on the ravages that
Virus brought to those worlds as well. News of the carnage has leaked in
through Vozoekeng (2832), which managed to avoid getting the full brunt of
Virus.

A very small amount of trade continues between these worlds and Vozoekeng.
Due to the scarcity of jump 4 ships, most ships carry drop tanks or
collapsible fuel tanks in order to make the long journey between worlds.
The patrols at Dhorue are quite thorough in examining ships for possible
Viral contamination. They realize that one mistake means death for their
world. Both worlds have also seen population increases due to immigration
as well as through natural reproduction.

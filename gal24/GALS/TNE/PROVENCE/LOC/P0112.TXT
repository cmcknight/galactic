was too small a target. They have managed to keep their ships running by
occasionally foraging through the ruins of Ghoghzsorgh (212) for equipment.
With such a small gene pool (711 inhabitants in 1200), long term survival
will require an influx of fresh DNA. It is unaminously agreed that a more
aggressive search for other survivors is in order.

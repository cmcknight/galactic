
Taarskoerzn (1835) was the capital of the Glory of Taarskoerzn, a state
which only consisted of 7 member worlds prior to 1116. Jealous of their
rivals, the Irrgh Manifest, they enlisted the aid of corsairs to go against
them. The Church of the Chosen Ones provided moral support to their cause.
In 1116, they plowed their way into Corridor, splitting the Irrgh Manifest
in two. Riding high on their success, they began plotting the next phase of
their expansion. They were caught by surprise when a united fleet of
corsairs overwhelmed Depot. As a result, they soon found themselves taking
orders rather then giving them. (Vilani & Vargr pg.53-54)

The next blow to Taarskoerzn came from Virus. Two billion people died as
the world was thrown into chaos. Emerging from this chaos was the Church.
Feeling betrayed by what they saw as self-serving pompousness, they turned
on the government seeking to punish them for what befell their world. They
have been merciless. They now dominate most of the planet. A few splinter
groups are trying to resist the Church, claiming that the world has
suffered enough and it is now time to heal. Offworlders should exercise
extreme caution when visiting Taarskoerzn. The Church will not hesitate to
blame offworlders for the current plight of their world.

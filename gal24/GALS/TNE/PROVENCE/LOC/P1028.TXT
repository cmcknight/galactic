
A local chapter of the Church of the Chosen Ones has come to power on Tuegu
(1028). Before the Collapse, the Church held little power. With the dozen
nation-states humbled, the Church began to preach that an era of rebirth
and spirituality had begun. "The sinners have been punished and it is now
time for the Church to guide our lives." Tens of millions of Vargr were
swayed and have joined the Church. Sufficiently strong, the Church has
announced that a Crusade will begin to convert the whole world. Those that
will not convert will be slain. Needless to say, the remnants of the
nation-states are not too pleased by this proclamation.

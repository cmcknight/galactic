
Approximately 75 billion people died on Daekvagul (2540) as a result of
Virus contaminated equipment. The carnage was so great that the world
received a "tainted" atmospheric rating for a few decades. Cities in orbit
spaced their inhabitants and plunged to the world below while cities
hovering over the oceans sank. Legends among the survivors tell of these
cities engaging in Oukskfalok, the Vargr equivalent of jousting or
"chicken" in Anglic slang. In a few spots, several cities piled up to form
artificial islands. Eventually, the submerged portions were colonized by
coral organisms. Other aquatic and avian species then began to make their
homes in and on these islands. Pursuing the supply of game, many people
have abandoned the mainland and surrounding natural islands for these new
habitats.

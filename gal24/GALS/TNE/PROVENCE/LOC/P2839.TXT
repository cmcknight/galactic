
Garogag (2839) was a balkanized world for centuries. Priests from the
Church of the Chosen Ones somehow managed to unite the people under a
single government, them. They were fairly strict and after a couple of
decades prohibited viewpoints that disagreed with the Church. Virus was
more than the Church could handle. A self-proclaimed atheist TED has arose
during the chaos and quickly took advantage of the situation. Although the
Church still rules a portion of the world, along with a few other splinter
groups, they no longer dominate.

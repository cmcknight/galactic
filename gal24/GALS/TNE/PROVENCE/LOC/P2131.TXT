
Uedzoghaeg (2131) was named after the ruler of the world. He lost
popularity with the citizenry when he failed to unite himself with the
Glory of Taarskoerzn. Too strong to overthrow, he remained in power. He was
present at the starport when Virus struck and died when it plummeted to the
world below. Thinking it was just a prelude to invasion by Taarskoerzn
forces, a new government formed and the citizenry voted to rename the
world, Kfaegh. No invaders have ever come. Succeeding generations of Vargr
have kept the name but not the desire to join the Glory.

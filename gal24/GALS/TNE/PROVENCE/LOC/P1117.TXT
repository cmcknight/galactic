
Koenalor (1117) was not hit too hard by Virus. Granted the world had its
starport damaged, lost some ships, and had its infrastructure shaken down,
but for the most part it's intact and still with a functional starport
as well the ability to maintain spaceflight capable ships. The current
dictator on Koenalor, Zoedhae Gvaenglang, has instituted several reforms
increasing personal freedoms for the people.

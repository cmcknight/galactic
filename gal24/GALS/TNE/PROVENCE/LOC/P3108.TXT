
Uedh Kal (3108), owned by the company of the same name, served as a reverse
engineering/research institute. Although only legally permitted to deal
with the Empire, the owners realized that a diversified client base was
much more preferrable. As such, they traded with regional governors in the
Empire as well as cosairs and other interstellar states. Being somewhat
remote, they were able to avoid getting hit with Virus for some time.
Expecting to be attacked by warships, a much needed supply ship did not
receive a thorough inspection. It contained an egg which, when hatched,
went right to the environmental controls. Whether or not it is still
present is unknown. Its remote location has been an inconvenience to
privateers.

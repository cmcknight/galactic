
Lighoz Subsector: The Lighoz Subsector has an estimated population in 1202
of approximately 10.0 billion, a decline of 86.5% from its Pre-Collapse
population. Ug Kanek has the highest population (6 billion). Lighoz has the
highest tech level rating (9). The Lighoz subsector had an estimated
population in 1120 of approximately 74.2 billion. Its highest population
was 50 billion at Arerzthoe, and its highest tech level was 13 at Uedtzon
and Kirg.

Subsector Notes:

The large number of asteroid belts in otherwise habitable zones in a few
systems (Dzaegzaek, Anthonkfoers, Aenggvug, Gingrue, Aeghzisung and
Orgukung in Voudzeur subsector) has led Vargr researchers to conclude that
these worlds were once whole. They believe that these worlds were destroyed
during the War of the Ancients. No evidence has yet been found to back up
this claim.

Virus hit this subsector hard and the Vargr themselves are partly to blame.
The eagerness of the Dzarrgh Federate, Irrgh Manifest, and numerous corsair
groups to plunder the undefended Corridor and weakened Imperium was their
own undoing. Infected ships and systems would return to their bases and
starports and unwittingly spread the contagion to their comrades and
allies. Only 1 (Lighoz) of the 28 systems in this subsector still has
anything resembling a functional starport by 1202.

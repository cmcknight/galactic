
Kaegrogz (1214) was a regional capital for the Empire of Varroerth. Several
corsairs were allowed to operate in the area on behalf of Kaegrogz and the
other Empire of Varroerth worlds. They teamed up with the Windhorn Alliance
for the raids on Corridor. They weren't above attacking other corsairs and
the Irrgh Manifest either. As a precursor to expansion for the Empire,
naval ships from Kaegrogz began to raid non-empire worlds in the rimward
half of the subsector in 1129. In 1135, despite warnings of the coming of
Virus, which was scoffed at as being an Imperial hoax, a naval squadron set
out for Igzinghuell (1316). They arrived in time to find the world already
under bombardment by the world's own navy. Although hardened warriors
themselves, they were nonetheless thrown off guard by this sight. The Empire
Builder strain of Virus in control of the Igzinghuell navy quickly grabbed
control of the Kaegrogz squadron. With "juicier" targets lying spinward and
coreward, the ships were refuelled and sent back to Kaegrogz where they
infected the rest of the Kaegrogz navy and nuked the planet.

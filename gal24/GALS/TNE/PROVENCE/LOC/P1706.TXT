
The tech level for Anur (1706) in the UWP for 1120 is misleading. The
monarchy enjoyed the fruits of their subjects' labor. They imported high
tech goods from offworld while their subjects lived at tech level 7.
Working in the factories was mandatory. Conditions tended to be poor.
Dissidence was forbidden. The police made sure that the people remained in
line. Rebellion came when Virus sent the starport crashing down into the
capital city. As cities and industrial parks were being bombarded, the
people fled, often taking advantage of the confusion to attack local law
enforcement.

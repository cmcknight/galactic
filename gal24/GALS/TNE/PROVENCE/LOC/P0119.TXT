
Nogh (119) is arguably the most intact world in the subsector (C starport
TL 9). Occasionally, a ship will travel to Zadz (120) to trade in a few
goods and raw materials but this is extremely limited as Zadz's starport
was destroyed and the tech level has been knocked down to 4. Nogh's other
neighbor, Oughdzak (219), was rendered lifeless.

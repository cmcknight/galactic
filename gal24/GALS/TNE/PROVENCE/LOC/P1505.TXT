
Vorvoun (1505) has remained somewhat intact though nowhere near the level
it once was. In recent years trade has resumed with a couple of other
worlds: Kaengku (1605) and Farrurgneng (1403). A pair of survey vessels are
scheduled to begin exploration of the Grnouf Jump-1 Main from Aekaedho
(1106) to Foukakh (2405) later this year (1202).

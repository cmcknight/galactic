Subsector Notes:

The Aenkuk subsector has been dominated by the Irrgh Manifest for
centuries. Although the boundaries of this state has waxed and waned
through the years, it has steadfastedly held the majority of the worlds in
this subsector. Virus succeeded in loosening that grip.

Little interstellar trade continues today. Only Nokoegz (1224), Llokhaegueg
(1226), Nurrok (1424), and Ezksog (1525) are able to maintain enough ships
to continue trade. The starports are considered neutral territory on
Nokoegz and Llokhaegueg. Off-worlders should exercise caution on these 2
worlds. The nation states of these worlds are desperately trying to hold
onto what remaining bits of technology they can scrounge and will not
hesitate to attack a perceived weakness.

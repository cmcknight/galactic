Subsector Notes:

Virus hit this subsector hard and the Vargr themselves are partly to blame.
The eagerness of the Irrgh Manifest, Glory of Taarskoerzn, and numerous
corsair groups to plunder the undefended Corridor and weakened Imperium was
their own undoing. Infected ships and systems would return to their bases
and starports and unwittingly spread the contagion to their comrades and
allies. Only 1 (Gvalur) of the 21 systems in this subsector still has
anything resembling a functional starport by 1202.

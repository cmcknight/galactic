
Bewildered by the ruins reaped upon Ghakong (1020) by Virus, the citizenry
lost hope. No one could decide what action to take to start the rebuilding
process and those few who tried, failed miserably. A group, calling
themselves the Zoloutsitsaekh, offered a plan of renewal but the price
would be to turn over the reins of government to them. Having encountered
nothing but failure, the people voted (by a 3:1 margin) to be ruled by the
Zoloutsitsaekh. Since coming to power, they have curtailed many personal
freedoms, including weapon ownership, yet haven't provided anything more
than meager infrastructure improvements and the appearance of order.
Although they have been strict, the Zoloutsitsaekh have not abused their
power.

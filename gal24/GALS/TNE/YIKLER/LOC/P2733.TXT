   much like high-density version of Venus. Observers of the world have
   often commented that any colonists would have to be insane to settle
   there.
   
   The first humans on the world agreed with this point of view. Their
   colony ship, containing thousands of people in cold sleep, entered the
   system purely to refuel before heading onto Greytown. After a
   ridiculous series of engineering "accidents" (the apparent sabotage
   could never be investigated properly), the ship was forced to crash
   land on to this world. Their Chief Pilot, Edgar MacWilliams
   (progenitor of the MacWilliams pilot dynasty in the MacCormick line),
   managed to land the vessel with most of the main hull intact, though
   hundreds of colonists died.
   
   The survivors located a series of extensive tunnels, which were sealed
   off, to set up a subterranean colony using scavenged parts of the
   starship and its cargo. The subsequent discovery of a native creature
   inhabiting the black tunnels of Caveat, which had developed a level of
   intelligence bordering on full sentience, guided the colonists towards
   an industry devoted to living with the ecology of their tunnel homes.
   
   Though now a democracy, a period of civil disruption saw much
   factional fighting in the caverns and tunnels separating the
   underground towns. The introduction of mercenaries from Glenaura
   shortened but bloodied the "civil action" considerably. Some
   settlements are even now actively anti-Glenauran, even though their
   differences with their government are settled by their elected
   representatives inside the council chambers.
   
   Caveat is a member of the Glenauran Signatorate and part of the
   Scottish bloc.

   
   Forge (1531) is a low-density vacuum world, with a surface gravity of
   0.1g, a mean surface temperature of 181.2 degrees, no water and a day
   length of 38 hrs 16 mins. It was settled by choice in the late 500's
   by the Faith. Forge is the main place of Trial for the Faith.
   
   The military training schools all moved here in the mid 720's, as
   Hammer was considered too benign to shape the warrior elite they were
   seeking.

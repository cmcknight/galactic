   
   Qriensh Jdazh (0837) is a captured high density planet in a highly
   elliptical orbit about the primary, out of the ecliptic. At certain
   points in the orbit, the world enters the habitable zone of the star
   and life blooms. The population harvests the unusual lifeforms that
   have adapted to these conditions and extract various chemicals from
   them. The rotational period of the world is 37 hours.
   
   The planet is very rocky and craggy, with many active volcanoes, each
   surrounded by an ash plain. There are only 7 tectonic plates (called
   basins, locally) of any size on the world, surrounded by mountains and
   ravines caused by plate movements. Each of the basins has a government
   of its own, most being companies.
   
   Referee's Notes: 
   
   (1) The only cooperation between the governments is to pursue those
   who try to slip in unnoticed at harvest time for a piece of the
   action. The governments sometimes employ offworlders as workers,
   particularly those with technical skills. Other governments sometimes
   try to slip saboteurs into the workforce of other governments and
   employ security staff to protect themselves against the saboteurs of
   others.
   
   (2) Some of the lifeforms have unusual regenerative properties which
   are sold to (generally Zhodani) companies interested in anagathics
   drugs. The governments which are companies are either divisions or
   subsidiaries of such companies).
   
   (3) The permanent inhabitants practice zero population growth, due to
   the limitations of life support.

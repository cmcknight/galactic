   The people of the Izrats Kriezhlas occupy twelve of the fifteen
   inhabited systems in this subsector. The subsector capital is
   Tliadrstatl (2439) and the Izrats Kriezhlas Unity capital,
   Qrazhazhjal (2137), is also present.
   
   The Izh Kriezhlal subsector contains 21 worlds with a total population
   of 36.973 billion. The highest population is at Qrazhazhjal, with 26.2
   billion. The highest tech level is E at both Itsplanzhikar and

   comprises about 12% racial Zhodani, 83% Izrats Kriezhlas Vlazhdumecta,
   5% other races. Izrats Kriezhlas/Zhodani/Solomani hybrids are usually
   considered Izrats Kriezhlas.
   
   Worlds generated according to World Tamer's Handbook where applicable
   and World Builders Handbook otherwise. Note that atmospheric taints
   generated using WBH, since World Tamer's is intended only for worlds
   already known to be habitable.

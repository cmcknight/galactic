   
   Majdr (0934) is a tidally locked world with a corrosive mix
   atmosphere, including HCl, HF, SO2, and Neon. Not surprisingly, Majdr
   was not settled in the first Dlarashtsalash push but was instead first
   colonised around -1620 as a remote mining/trade station.
   
   After colonisation, the world prospered for several hundred years,
   selling ores, radioactives and other goods wrested from the mines. The
   station grew and the world became a popular market for goods from
   coreward and spinward. However, the mines gradually closed and the
   main trade routes moved further rimward. Now, the world has regressed
   almost to the point where it will not be able to support itself in its
   corrosive environment. The world survives as it is still the only link
   to the Carillon to coreward.
   
   As a result of its declining technology, several practices have arisen
   to cope with the more frequent leakages of gas into the Majdra
   caverns. Many people have taken to wearing heavy cosmetics to hide
   disfiguring from such occurrences. Alarmed by its decreasing
   population (now only 8440), the government proclaimed in 1073 that
   marriage can only be for a standard year. Numerous concessions were
   announced for people who produced offspring from multiple partners.
   
   Due to the chilly mean surface temperature of -172.1 degrees, the main
   population centre, Majdras, is situated in natural caverns about 600m
   beneath the Stealas Mtns (which are found in less severe temperatures
   on the day side). The starport is about 30km below on the plains.

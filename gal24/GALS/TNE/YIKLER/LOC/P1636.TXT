   
   Zdantsplitskliepl (1636) is a harsh, cold, tidally locked world (mean
   surface temperature -170.3 degrees) which has changed House ownership
   several times in its history. The hydrosphere covers 87% of the
   surface, but exists only in the form of ice. The ice in the twilight
   and night side regions of the world are mixed with frozen atmospheric
   gases.
   
   The population live in deep caverns and rifts scattered over the
   surface of the day side. Several rifts have been sealed and filled
   with air forming the larger communities with parkland and more
   "natural" surroundings. All citizens must spend a portion of the year
   in service to their House to ensure access to environmental
   facilities. Food supplies still remain difficult, so many are
   vegetarians. The world is a major art and cultural centre.

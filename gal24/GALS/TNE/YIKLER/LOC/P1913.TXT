   
   Iachonz (1913 B888676-A) is a Consulate system located on the
   Consulate/Meichntid Ibl border. The planet is balkanised into eight
   distinct nation states, each of which is a member of the Consulate.
   
   Although each nation is a member of the Consulate, all have resisted
   Consulate inspired attempts to form a unified world government.
   Attempts at promoting world unity seem to have failed largely due to
   lack of interest on the part of the population. It appears that each
   nation state is quite content with being in control of it's own
   affairs and is uninterested in having to deal with the problem of
   people from the other side of the planet.
   
   During the S'raak War the system was a major battlefield between
   Consulate and Meichntid Ibl forces with widespread ground fighting
   taking place. Wreckage and debris from the war is still turning up
   quite regularly and a thriving salvage industry has grown since the
   war.
   
   At the end of the S'raak War several neighbouring systems were ceded
   to Meichntid Ibl as compensation for the wrongful (and ill fated)
   invasion of that state by the Consulate. This has left Iachonz
   virtually within the Meichntid Ibl borders. While military planners
   complain that this leaves the system vulnerable to military action and
   subversion by the Meichntid Ibl, it has proved to be an economic boon
   to the planet. A great deal of Meichntid Ibl trade now passes through
   the system.
   
   The Consulate Navy maintains a major Naval installation in the system
   and this has brought howls of protest from Meichntid Ibl authorities
   who accuse the Consulate of warmongering.

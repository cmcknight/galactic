   
   Vrontliedl (0338) is a low density, tidally locked world, colonised in
   1134 by Sitiefladr. Earthquakes gave difficulties and the colony was
   abandoned in 1148, when a massive earthquake destroyed their main
   dome. Occasional passing ships stop to rummage through the ruins for
   things of value.
   
   The ruins of their starport remains, considered type D. There is a
   fusion power plant, but it is unreliable (the only reason why no-one
   has taken it).
   
   Referee: Someone has set up some solar sails as backup for the power
   plant, so the old base can be used as a temporary emergency refuge for
   stranded travellers. The facilities are deteriorating as the years
   pass, and will reach type E soon. The ruins of the repair yards
   remain, and so some repairs can be performed by ship crews in
   extremis. There are obviously no brokers or any of the other normal
   starport facilities.

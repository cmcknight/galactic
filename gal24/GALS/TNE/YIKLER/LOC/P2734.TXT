   
   Glenaura (2734): Glenaura is a pleasant world, offering a mild climate
   with an enjoyable atmosphere. The population, which is of Scottish
   origin, takes full advantage of these, tending towards a decentralised
   society.
   
   Despite these advantages, the early colony almost failed. Problems
   with the soil and the native plant life forced farmers to resort to
   hydroponics and imports (the only exception being a geneered creature
   based on sheep). Additional problems, such as a marked lack of
   minerals other than radioactives, led to specialisation in exports of
   information technology and mercenaries.
   
   The mercenaries of Glenaura are highly trained, well motivated and
   led, expensive and successful. Though specialising in ground troops,
   some COAAC and High Guard forces are available, the latter notable for
   the fact that they use Aslan constructed ships from Kusiahatai. These
   soldiers have seen action all over the subsector, with some companies
   ranging even further.
   
   Notable for a world its size is the fact that there is no established
   government. Some families have, over generations, specialised in
   providing certain services, and continue to do so. This is a little
   chaotic at times, but the natives prefer the freedom that working
   within a family based capitalist system gives them. Travel on the
   surface is restricted, and prior permission to enter a family's lands
   is always required. If caught without permission, an offworlder is
   subject to the justice system of that family.
   
   The ruin of the old Vlazhdumecta base is a minor tourist attraction.

   
   Vrier (0314 C7A4000-0): is a Zhodani forbidden system located in
   Izellensjdash subsector. This system was inhabited, with a population
   exceeding one million, until 1112. In that year some sort a
   catastrophe befell the planet. When regularly scheduled flights from
   the system failed to arrive in the nearby system of Japradlie, a
   warship was dispatched to investigate.
   
   Precisely what the vessel found is open to speculation. All that is
   known for sure is that the system was immediately declared a forbidden
   system and strictly off limits to civilian traffic. The Consulate
   government refuse to discuss the system with the media or relatives of
   the missing population.

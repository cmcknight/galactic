   
   Chtashekldlanz (0534) is a high density world (surface gravity 1.0
   standard), used by Talpaku and Fliblshichtia (0434) companies, none of
   which claim the system. So the world is effectively balkanised, each
   "government" being a different company.
   
   Large areas are dried up oceans, so there are huge salt flats, with
   some intermittent rivers and salt lakes in the deeper portions. The
   companies harvest minerals from these salt flats. The sights are quite
   unusual; in one area, a deep trench between tectonic plates holds
   water but the bordering hills and flats are quite dry. Day and night
   temperatures can be at opposite extremes, due to the 42 hour
   rortational period.
   
   Most companies involved are operating at tech 9. In the case of
   Fliblshichtia, this is because that is their prevailing tech level. In
   the case of the Talpaku, this is because they are companies who have
   learnt from Zdemedre (0332) and have bought up cheap, surplus
   equipment to survive. The Talpaku companies are working with mixed
   tech 9 and A.
   
   Referee's Notes: 
   
   (1) There are some clashes, which are usually secret (like commando
   raids to disrupt operations) but sometimes overt (mercenaries hired to
   throw those of another company out of some area they believe are
   trespassing). The world has no native life.
   
   (2) There are occasionally heavy rainstorms in the regions near the
   remaining water, which transform the landscape into one of rushing
   rivers and lakes.

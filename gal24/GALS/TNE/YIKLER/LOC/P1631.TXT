   
   Hammer (1631) has a number of huge volcanoes that have spewed sulphur
   compounds into the atmosphere for centuries. If it were not for these,
   Hammer would be a livable (if hot) world (mean surface temperature
   53.5 degrees, day length 303 days). The surface of Hammer is shrouded
   in a thick fog for most of the time. This is due to the hydration of
   sulphur trioxide in the air, which condenses and forms; amongst other
   things; pyrosulphuric acid (H2S2O7) which dilutes in water to form
   sulphuric acid. Hammer is a high density world, leading to a surface
   gravity of 1.2g.
   
   Hammer was settled by choice in the late 500's by the Faith. A good
   sense of smell is vital here. Atmosphere leaks are common and the
   early detection of the sulphurous smell can mean the difference
   between life and death.

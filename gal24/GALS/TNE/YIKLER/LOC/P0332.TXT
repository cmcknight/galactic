   
   Zdemedre (0332) is being exploited by a Talpaku company from Salty
   Tears named Kzetawekuk General Minerals. Neither the company nor the
   Communality claims the world, which is why the allegiance code is "Not
   aligned". Operations were originally expected to be temporary and are
   still considered to be such, despite the length of occupancy. The
   workers are all recruited from off-world and return home after their
   contract is complete.
   
   The company moved here to avoid bankruptcy around 1180. It was forced
   to make such a radical decision when it found that its inability to
   upgrade its equipment in line with competitors was freezing it out of
   local operations. It found that profits here are enough to keep the
   company going, but not so high that others come here to compete with
   them. The company has stabilised at that tech level ever since.
   
   The major event in the history of the system was recent the attack by
   Quicksilver (0233).

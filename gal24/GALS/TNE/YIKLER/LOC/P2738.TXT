   
   Iqlneshav (2738): An inhospitable world occupied by ethnically Zhodani
   colonists, intent on eking out a living on their small world. Refusing
   to accept the Driantia Steblenzhtia reforms of 666, the nobles seceded
   and maintained power through control of technology. Noble lines are
   maintained by pure heredity and psionics training is available only to
   the nobility (if only because no-one else can afford to send their
   children off world to a Psionics Institute).
   
   Merchants and other travellers are made very welcome in the small
   starport, but once outside it the reception is quite the opposite.
   Individuals must give a good reason to officials before permission to
   leave the starport can be gained.

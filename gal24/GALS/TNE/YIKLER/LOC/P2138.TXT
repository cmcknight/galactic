   rest of the Unity as being just a bit too lacking in everything. The
   atmosphere has just too low an oxygen percentage for it to be readily
   breathable, the hydrosphere is just that bit too great (84%) for a
   small world to have enough land for a large colony, the surface
   atmospheric pressure is a little too high (1.3 standard) to be
   pleasant, most of the land happens to be in hot equatorial latitudes
   (base surface temperature 24.3 degrees C) and the native life is just
   a little too primitive (being in a "Cambrian" stage of early/mid
   aerobic development). The people of other systems use the word
   Eleshtepri to describe something that is almost but not quite good
   enough, which greatly annoys the locals, who disagree with all these
   assessments. Most of the locals are sufficiently acclimatised to the
   conditions that they can survive outside without a mask for several
   days, particularly if no strenuous activity is performed.
   
   The world has more traffic than the starport would suggest, as it is a
   jump-2 connection between core and rimward. Unfortunately, the locals
   cannot afford to improve the starport and the reputation of the system
   (justified or otherwise) prevents off-world finance being made
   available.

   high percentage of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. The atmosphere is
   poisonous to humans and even most filter masks cannot cope with the
   strong taint. In addition, the increased albedo has resulted in a base
   surface temperature of about 100 degrees Celsius. Apart from the
   obvious effect on unprotected human skin, the huge oceans constantly
   boil off at the equator and condense at the poles, in constant
   torrential rain. Fierce ocean currents stream from the the poles to
   the equator, to replace boiled off water. For obvious reasons,
   wilderness refuelling is best done at the gas giant.

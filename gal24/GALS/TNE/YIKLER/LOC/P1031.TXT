   
   Yellow Ocean (1031) is a water world orbiting a gas giant in the
   habitable zone of its star. The atmosphere has a sulphur taint,
   forcing the Carillon who live there to either wear special suits,
   filter plugs or (if permanent residents) to adapt their respiration
   biosystems accordingly. There are several other colonies in this
   system with significant populations (in the millions).

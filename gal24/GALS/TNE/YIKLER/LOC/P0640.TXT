   density, tidally locked world have condensed or frozen out. The result
   is an atmosphere that is breathable only with the assistance of a
   filter mask and heat suit (minimum). There is no native life.
   
   Referee: The world was originally settled in the 680s by the Driantia
   Sitiefladr, which abandoned the settlers in 695. The settlers had all
   died by the end of 697, when the last of the life support failed. They
   settlers could have lasted longer, but they lost their "thin veneer"
   of civilisation, and fought to the death for possession of filter
   masks and other life sustaining equipment.

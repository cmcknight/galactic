   civilisation. The civilisation appears to have had a very irregular
   technological advancement, with certain areas more higher developed
   than others. Despite the present high population, there are many areas
   on the world which have never been properly searched for ruins, and so
   there is a thriving industry supporting amateur archaeologists. The
   world is also curious in that it has totally lost its atmosphere,
   which is unusual for a world of this size. It is believed that the
   loss of atmosphere is linked in some way to the death of the ancient
   civilisation, but this has never been proven. Some say that the world
   is an unusual Ancients site, others say that the Ancients destroyed
   the civilisation for some reason, others again say that a huge
   meteorite impact was responsible.

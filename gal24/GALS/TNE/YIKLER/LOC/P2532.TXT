   facility was ruthlessly run until recently taken over in a coup led by
   a woman named Chtalfent Kiench Fleqrivr. She has ruled the outpost for
   the past five years with the support of the workers, maintaining the
   previous production standards but with a much happier work force. A
   landing field and fuel supply are maintained to encourage merchants to
   visit often, if irregularly.
   
   There are also occasional visitors who search for the old Vlazhdumecta
   supply base which is believed to be located somewhere in this system.
   The locals post a standing reward of Cr 50,000 (or twice this value in
   ore) for discovery of the base, since it would bring extra traffic to
   the world and boost the economy.
  
   Referee's Information:
 
   (1) There is no Vlazhdumecta base in the system, but
   a group of dishonest locals are using their mining equipment to
   construct fake ruins under an overhanging cliff in the far northern
   latitudes. They hope to claim the reward and disappear before anyone
   sees through the scam. The activity is only on a part time basis, but
   the last searcher was unlucky enough to be discovered by the miners
   and killed for her trouble. She came from a family of moderate means
   on nearby Dushegadaar, where her sister is considering a trip to try
   to solve the mystery of her disappearance.
   
   (2) Players with Prospecting skill should be allowed to try their
   luck. The local government encourages people to search unclaimed
   regions of the world (in the hope of discovering ore-rich areas) and
   charges only a nominal fee.

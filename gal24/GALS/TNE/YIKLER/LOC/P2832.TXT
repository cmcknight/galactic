   
   Duneed (2832): has a rich asteroid belt that has led to the
   development of a booming mining and heavy industrial economy. Although
   Duneed has only a moderate population, it has produced some of the
   largest merchant houses in the subsector, making it a centre of
   speculation and investment.
   
   Duneed was an early builder of non-starships, to support belter
   activities and habitats. Later, to assist exports of the raw and
   processed produce of their burgeoning economy, the yard was improved
   so that it could build special bulk carriers and other mercantile
   starships.
   
   The people live in habitats in the belt. Each has a number of votes in
   the central party based on its population, which then leads to the
   selection of the portfolio ministers. These in turn choose the head of
   government, called the Prime Minister.

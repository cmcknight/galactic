   
   Dushegadaar (2531): This pleasant world is home to a population of
   mostly Vilani descent. It is mainly notable for its shipyard, which
   produces an amazing array of ships up to 2000 tons in size. Unlike
   Duneed and Kusiahatai, Dushegadaar rarely produces two ships from the
   same set of blueprints. Some popular models, however, are consistently
   constructed with extensive customisation. A majority of the ships
   constructed here head out for ports unknown and are not registered in
   the subsector.
   
   It has been noted that a number of captured and defeated corsair and
   pirate ships bear the mark of being constructed on Dushegadaar. Some
   feel that the government of Dushegadaar actually takes commissions for
   building pirate ships directly from the felons, for the system is
   known as a safe haven from pirate attack. The amazing assortment of
   goods available onworld lead some to suspect that some come from the
   holds of looted merchant ships.
   
   Whatever the case, anyone with the money can have any ship
   modifications done at Dushegadaar.

   
   Iareflonzal (2933): A system in the cluster of the same name, occupied
   by ethnic Zhodani who don't believe in psionics being the measure of a
   persons nobility. Instead they believe nobility is a hereditary
   position, involving breeding and proper behaviour.
   
   The tidally locked mainworld was originally settled as part of the
   Driantia Steblenzhtia, but the local nobles decided to secede rather
   than accept the reforms of 666. They ruled that since they were
   responsible for the people, only they should be in control of such
   essential services as environmental control, food production and water
   harvesting. Since the world has virtually no atmosphere, these
   services are heavily technologically oriented, leading to the
   government code.
   
   Visitors are required to pay an air tax and may trade in restricted
   technologies only with the government. Penalties for smuggling of vacc
   suits and similar items are high, but offworlders who respect these
   restrictions are treated well.
   
   Iareflonzal is now part of the Glenauran Signatorate, leader of the
   Zhodani bloc. In the last few years, the population has been increased
   by 25% as the result of Zhodani refugees. Some have had trouble
   adapting to the change of political system, leading to some political
   instability at the moment.

   which taint the atmosphere. Although it is a cool world (base surface
   temperature 1.5 degrees C), there is native life. People live with
   their extended families, rather than alone. There are no cities as
   such, as each House has extensive holdings where all of that House
   live and work. There is little interaction between Houses, except at
   the starport. This has led to many genetic interbred traits, so it is
   now a requirement that people must undergo an extensive genetic
   analysis before marriage is allowed. In family life, the adults are
   given food and the children eat what is left over.

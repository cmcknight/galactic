   
   Yadrishipl (3035): A Zhodani outpost that was established by a noble
   family to produce gas products from the large gas giant the mainworld
   orbits. It has limited contact with the Glenauran Signatorate,
   preferring to trade with the other Zhodani worlds in Rom's Loch and
   occasional Driantia Steblenzhtia contact.
   
   Although tidally locked to the gas giant, the rotational period around
   it gives it an effective day length of 20.2 standard days with respect
   to the primary.

   0.3 g), tidally locked to the primary with a mean surface temperature
   of -156.59 degrees.
   
   Theoretically, this settlement should not be able to exist, since the
   people of Pranjadraparats maintain their tech level below that
   generally considered feasible for survival on such a barren world. A
   small group settled this world in 957 as a refuge from which to
   experience the causal world. They are a devout group of monks who
   spend most of their lives undertaking psionic disciplines with which
   to focus and test the inner mind. The group has slowly grown and is
   now almost double its original size. All members, male and female,
   wear little or nothing, as a refutation of the physical world. The
   community itself, called Shiatlenj, is in caves deep within a large
   chasm. There are no signs of the settlement from the ground, apart
   from a small fuel dump and beacon. Those devout enough to join must
   locate the community for themselves. The monks sometimes to consent to
   teach those who will journey to find them.

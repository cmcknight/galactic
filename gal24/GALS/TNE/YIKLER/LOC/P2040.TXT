   it was settled so early is now a mystery. It has a dense irritant
   atmosphere (surface pressure 2.4 standard), a massive ocean
   (consisting of an atmosphere related chemical mix) that covers 99% of
   the surface and a mean surface temperature varying from 45.3 degrees C
   to 70.3 degrees C (the higher temperature being when the planet comes
   into conjunction between the two stars.
   
   Everyone wears protective clothing at all times, in case of an
   environment breach. The constant worries about breaches (though these
   are now actually quite rare) have led to numerous superstitions, such
   as breaches occurring more often at conjunctions. There is also a fear
   of being outside, so virtually all external operations are performed
   by remote controlled robots. As an added safety measure, everyone
   works as part of a team, with each person relying on the other
   members. The emphasis on teams has led to people of a team socialising
   together outside of work and to marriage taking place only within a
   House. Many clubs prefer to operate clandestinely, since members may
   be discriminated against for spending too much time away from their
   fellow team members. Some of these clubs are actually convenient
   fronts for secret societies.

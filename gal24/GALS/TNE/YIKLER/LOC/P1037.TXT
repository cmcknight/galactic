   this region of space. The low density of the mainworld results in a
   surface gravity of only 0.55g and the mean surface temperature is
   -121.2 degrees. Being tidally locked to the primary, the major cities
   are near the centre of the day side, where it is still -66.8 degrees.
   
   With practically no resources to advance their economy, the government
   saw an opportunity to improve their standard of living by specialising
   in low-tech weapons. They have become the major manufacturer for this
   market in this part of the sector, succeeding to the point that they
   need no other products or natural resources. All nobles are
   shareholders in the planetary company. As such, they are required to
   establish as much offworld contact as possible in order to market
   their wares.

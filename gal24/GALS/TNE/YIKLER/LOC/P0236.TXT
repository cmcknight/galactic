   
   Chablzhdia (0236) is a high density, tidally locked world, settled by
   discontents of Viezhdi' Shtaf (0137) in 1050. The discontents wanted a
   less arduous lifestyle (which they have, by comparison). Knowing that
   the authorities would not allow them to leave, they saved up some
   valuables and arranged secretly for a merchant ship to transport them
   to the nearest habitable world.
   
   Once the colony was established, word was smuggled back to compatriots
   on Viezhdi' Shtaf, and some have since been able to join them.
   Viezhdi' Shtaf is now aware of this colony but is unable to do
   anything about it. They have decided instead that the whole thing
   never happened.

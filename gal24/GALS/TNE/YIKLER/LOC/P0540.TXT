   
   Dliatlirets (0540) is the home of a bipedal humanoid alien race,
   called the Dliatlirets in Zdetl. They average 2.4m in height but more
   muscular. They have greenish skin (usually adorned with red and purple
   pigments). They have no nose and so, as the saying goes, cannot smell.
   Their heads tend to be circular and their arms protrude from about
   half way up their torsos.
   
   They respect physical prowess of all sorts, but particularly in
   military skills. They are sometimes employed offworld for bodyguard
   duties. They disdain higher technology, believing that it weakens
   moral fibre. The system is named for the Zhodani name for the race.
   
   The world has a rotational period of only 10 hours, one of the fastest
   in the sector. Day and night mean much less to the Dliatlirets race
   than most races.
   
   Referee: (1) Although unaware of any odours they might carry, they
   take umbrage at insults directed at them for this or any other reason.
   
   (2) Dliatlirets (the race) are difficult to fight in melee combat, due
   to their unusual body structure, so make attack rolls one level more
   difficult (unless the attacker has somehow had some experience or
   practice fighting them). The reverse is also true, but note that most
   Dliatlirets that players are likely to meet have had practice fighting
   humans.
   
   (3) This world and the alien race dwelling upon it will never be
   developed further. This allows referees to develop material without
   risking it be made redundant.

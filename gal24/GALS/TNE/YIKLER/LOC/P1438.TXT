   people. However the only permanent inhabitants are a small geneering
   project to survive high pressure conditions. The rest of the
   population consists of commuters from elsewhere in the system,
   tourists, and House troubleshooter/executives. As a government centre,
   and Consular Resort World, the system is a hive of activity and it has
   become mandatory for nobles to be assisted by robotic retinues. The
   robots are also of assistance outside the grav cities (due to the
   surface gravity of 1.3g).
   
   The very dense atmosphere at sea level (10 atmospheres) appears as a
   mist due to hydrographic based non-toxic taints. Many popular resorts
   are found at this level and in free floating gravitic cities. Sporting
   and health centres are common.
   
   The world has 2 satellites; one is used for farming (the mainworld has
   no native life) and the other is a colony. Both are also the home of
   Research stations. The system is the holding of Draj Alvar who
   instituted this rare form of government to foster technical
   development.

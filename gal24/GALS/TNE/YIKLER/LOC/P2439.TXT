   
   Tliadrstatl (2439) is a high density world, leading to a surface
   gravity of 1.8g. It is otherwise a pleasant world (mean surface
   temperature 18.5 degrees C) and features native life.
   
   Tliadrstatl is owned by a single House, which gives the House great
   influence, given that the system has long been the subsector capital.
   The system has long been interested in immigration and so there is a
   larger than normal population of non Izrats Kriezhlas. Most of these
   are Zhodani and Imperials, though there are even some Aslan and Vargr.
   
   Recently, the House has instituted isolationist policies and has
   prohibited offworld contact for the non Izrats Kriezhlas. This has
   fuelled racial tensions which previously did not exist, leading to
   increasingly fervent demonstrations, which occasionally deteriorate
   into riots. The Unity has threatened to move the subsector capital if
   the policies continue, but there has been no change as yet.
   
   Children are named after living relatives, which can be confusing to
   visitors.

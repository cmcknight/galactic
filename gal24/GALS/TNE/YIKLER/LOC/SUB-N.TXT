   The Dlarashtsalash subsector contains 26 worlds with a total
   population of 106.586 billion. The highest population is at Sejchiet,
   with 91.6 billion. The highest tech level is E at both Sejchiet and
   Jonjivr, while the lowest is 5 at Pranjadraparats. The population
   comprises about 10% racial Zhodani, 79% Izrats Kriezhlas Vlazhdumecta,
   5% Carillon and 6% other races. Izrats Kriezhlas/Zhodani/Solomani
   hybrids are usually considered Izrats Kriezhlas.
   
   Worlds generated according to World Tamer's Handbook where applicable
   and World Builders Handbook otherwise. Note that atmospheric taints
   generated using WBH, since World Tamer's is intended only for worlds
   already known to be habitable.

Dlarashtsalash Subsector Overview
   
   The Dlarashtsalash were an ishikin group of minor Izrats Kriezhlas
   Houses who colonised the spinward areas of this subsector in the mid
   -4000's. Their descendants still populate these scattered worlds. The
   Izrats Kriezhlas Unity holds six systems in the trailing-rimward
   corner of the subsector. They are the descendants of the main
   Vlazhdumecta colony almost 6,000 years ago.
   
   Protruding in from the coreward edge, the Carillon Harmonies has four
   major worlds. Considerable trade (mostly jump-2) flows through the
   region, heading for the Izrats Kriezhlas Unity to rimward and to the
   Talpaku Communality, Meichntid Ibl and Zhodani Consulate to coreward.
   A Jump-3 divide blocks easy trade to trailing.
   
   Two worlds to trailing of the Carillon worlds hold a colony of
   Solomani fanatics who settled there in the early 500's.

Library Data

   Dlarashtsalash: An ishikin group of six Minor Houses that colonised to
   spinward of Izh Kriezhlal in the mid -4,000's. The Houses hoped to
   increase status and power by extending the Izrats Kriezhlas Unity to
   new worlds. However, by stretching resources so soon after the
   resettlement, they assisted the disintegration of the nascent state.
   The general collapse of the Izh Kriezhlal colonies saw these farthest
   flung outposts isolated. Now all that remains of these six Houses is
   the scattered worlds of the subsector that bears their name.
   
   Izhde Dletsva: A small trading concern based on Rajash (1036). Most of
   it's activities are confined to the two systems within Jump-1 range.
   However, it has several Jump-2 ships which range farther afield on
   other ventures.
   
   Merchant Traders: One of the most frequently encountered ships along
   the Izrats Kriezhlas trade routes is the Tlatianim class 3,000 ton
   Merchant Cruiser. The Great Houses use these ships to carry trade
   throughout the sector. A number of ships are owned by consortia of
   Minor Houses to protect their interests and exert their independence.
   Originally constructed at Jump-2, a few have been refitted for Jump-4.
   However, there is little need for this within the Unity as the
   Tlatianim will just fit within a Jump-5 tender.
   
   PSR-4618+22: A low mass neutron star situated at 1334. It is a remnant
   of a supernova that occurred about 600,000 years ago. Its nebula is
   now over 3,000 parsecs wide and has been observed by the Zhodani Core
   Expeditions. The neutron star is less than 25km in diameter but is
   still listed as a hazard in astrogation programs. An observation post
   and fuel dump was established in the late -1200's but was abandoned
   several hundred years later. It may still be found orbiting the
   remnant although the fuel tanks are long dry.
   
   Popular folklore has it that the area for about two parsecs around
   this remnant is a "Bermuda Triangle", responsible for both an unusual
   number of appearances and disappearances of starships.
   
   A historical study carried out in 1039 found evidence to support the
   stories of an unusual number of misjump reappearances around the star,
   stretching back as far as the earliest use of jump drive. It is
   probable that there were many more occurrences than were recorded due
   to the low probability of a ship returning this point after misjump
   (although several have made it back using low berths). It would appear
   that the space for several light hours around the star is a 'magnet'
   for misjumped ships.
   
   Detailed studies, however, have shown no unusual history of
   disappearances.
   
   Shtier'a Wood: Harvested from the Shtier'a tree that grows only on
   Melchizhdrenk (1139). It is much sought after for numerous uses. As
   lumber, it is extremely useful as a low-tech construction material due
   to its resilience, high tensile strength, and decorative finish. The
   wood can also be processed to extract compounds useful in industrial
   chemistry.
   
   The Faith: In the late 500's, an extremist Solomani sect from the
   Sword Worlds arrived in the subsector, seeking a base to forge a new
   elite. They colonised Hammer (1631) and then immediately colonised the
   nearby world of Forge (1531).
   
   The inhabitants of Hammer and Forge simply refer to themselves as "the
   Faith". Their extreme views put them at odds with the Christian
   religions from which their beliefs were originally derived,. The main
   reason for this is their promotion of violence as a means to bring the
   social change they seek, but other factors, such as society based on
   communal polygamy, are also relevant. Only "Speakers of the Faith" can
   have contact with offworlders. Most consider the Faith to be dangerous
   psychotics.
   
   Due to the difficulties in food production on both worlds,
   vegetarianism is mandatory in Faith society. Only the strongest eat;
   those who are weaker must beg, steal, or forage for the leftovers of
   their betters. Anything less than perfect health is considered a sign
   of weakness and degeneracy.
   
   They loathe the Vlazhdumecta (since they are human yet have their
   unique biology) and the Carillon (as alien monsters) but have somehow
   managed friendly terms with the Zhodani. They have disputes with
   Zezhdishketl (1630) which have resulted in raids being mounted against
   that system, which is causing further tension with the Izrats
   Kriezhlas Unity (since Zezhdishketl is a client of the Unity).
   
   In order to be accepted as worthy of any position of prominence in
   Society, it is necessary to undergo a Trial. Forge is the most
   important place of Trial for the sect, since only those who survive a
   trial there can join the military or rise to power in the religious
   government. Those who fail a Trial there die. Hammer is otherwise used
   as the place of Trial. Those who succeed reap the reward they seek,
   while those who fail but survive are not accepted back into society,
   doomed to a remaining life that is difficult, short, and bleak.

   but is actually quite unusual due to the very long (97 standard day)
   retrograde rotational period, high gravity (1.8) and small axial tilt
   (17 degrees 34' 26"). The base surface temperature is 24.3 degrees C,
   but actual temperatures soar during the day and dive during the long
   night.
   
   Chedraz was on the verge of extinction after the initial collapse of
   the Izrats Kriezhlas Unity, due to difficulties in coping with the
   temperature extremes and certain native lifeforms. Only after Zhodani
   recontact were the problems solved, and the population has had a high
   regard for the Zhodani ever since. The population still believes that
   the Unity should remain a Zhodani client state and considered seceding
   from the Unity to remain part of the Zhodani Consulate (in the end,
   practicalities led to a decision to remain part of the Unity). The
   high regard in which the Zhodani found themselves here led to this
   world being the most popular for Zhodani settlement, and so there are
   twice as many racial Zhodani here as elsewhere in the Unity.
   
   All citizens are required to spend a year offworld before starting
   their career. In this way, they gain expertise and exposure to other
   ways of working.
   
   The unusual landscapes and lifeforms that have evolved to cope with
   the temperature extremes have led to the world being a popular leisure
   destination.

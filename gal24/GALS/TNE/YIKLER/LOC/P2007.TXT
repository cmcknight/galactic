   is the main Zhodani subsector capital in the sector. While it is true
   that the Zhodani hierarchy of councils does not include a sector level
   council, the Kizdalfa council is the senior council in the sector.
   Typically the Provincial Government sends its policy decisions through
   to Kizdalfa, which then relays the instructions onto the other
   subsector councils in the sector. Generally the other subsector
   councils in Yiklerzdanzh follow the Kizdalfa council's lead.
   
   The Consulate Navy has its major command base located at Kizdalfa.
   Theoretically, this is the home of Admiral Staedrlie and his general
   staff. However, in practice, the Grand Admiral and his staff tend to
   move around a great deal and have another major command base located
   at the main Depot, Reentschti (1206). The Naval headquarters at
   Kizdalfa tends to be administrative in nature with regards to command
   activities. The system is also home to a major naval installation and
   has a substantial fleet element based there.
   
   Kizdalfa itself is a small world, but with a very large population. A
   sizeable portion of the population lives in huge orbital complexes
   around the mainworld, as a large part of the planets surface is
   devoted to industry. However most of the population live on the
   surface in massive arcologies. Other planets and moons in the system
   have proved to be rich in metals and other valuable minerals. This has
   allowed Kizdalfa to produce many goods at a lower price.
   
   Kizdalfa has a high standard of living with a good level of wealth
   amongst the population. Many of the Zhodani corporations in
   Yiklerzdanzh are based upon Kizdalfa. The system has an average tech
   level of 14, but the Naval shipyards were upgraded to Tech Level 15
   seven years ago.

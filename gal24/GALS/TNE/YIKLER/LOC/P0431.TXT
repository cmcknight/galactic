   
   Fair Deal (0431) was originally settled by four groups, under a
   charter (from which the world was named). Relations soured until
   vicious wars resulted. The Communality tried to step in and broke a
   peace, but no-one was prepared to compromise. They then tried to
   enforce a peace, but the locals combined to fight back. Communality
   forces decided to withdraw when nuclear weapons were used against
   them. When the locals starting ambushing occasional merchant ships (to
   use in the war effort), the Communality declared a Red Zone until the
   wars are over, one way or the other.
   
   The mainworld orbits the DM companion. The world has facilities of
   higher tech level, but parts for these are starting to run out. It is
   likely that the faction which can hang on to higher tech level the
   longest will prevail. Each faction has already started raids on the
   others to steal parts ("nail" missions, quite literally)

   locked. However, rotation about Ekrpl-da produces seasons, which
   causes variations in pressure in the world's atmosphere. In "winter",
   the temperature drops to below the freezing point of most atmospheric
   gases, and the atmosphere is very thin (about 0.1 atm). In "summer",
   the temperature increases above freezing, and the liquid gas seas boil
   off to form a thin atmosphere (about 0.6 atm). The highest recorded
   temperature on the world is about -172 degrees. At this temperature,
   all atmospheric gases except carbon dioxide have boiled back into the
   atmosphere.
   
   The sole community on this world is divided into two opposing groups.
   The larger (population 25,400) is governed by the Izhde Dletsva, a
   small company which trades on Satsva, Rajash, and Ishnad. The other
   group (population 12,900) comprises renegade employees who staged an
   attempted "coup" several hundred years ago. They fight a cold war
   which occasionally flares into open violence. Both groups assist their
   control of their populations by limiting access to technology above
   TL5.
   
   The society on this world is found curious by many outsiders.
   Historically, only females are allowed to join the police forces.
   However, recent changes have extended this prohibition to include the
   entire judiciary. Due to a lack of growing space, the population of
   Rajash must consume calories in compact form. A traditional drink,
   still popular today is Bakr, a high protein/calorie beverage, which
   the mere presence of, for non-natives, causes nausea.

   little atmosphere and a lot of ice. Winter's Blanket is unusual in
   that it does not have a democratic government (all other major
   Carillon governments, including all the states of Dim Rock (1330), are
   democratic). Instead the planet and its voice in the Carillon
   Harmonies are controlled by the AI in the central computer, an
   intelligent geneered artefact. Individual Carillon can (and most do)
   make suggestions and offer their opinions, but the final decision is
   up to the AI. The IISS, unsure about how to classify an intelligent
   biological artefact, declared the government to be a benevolent
   dictatorship.

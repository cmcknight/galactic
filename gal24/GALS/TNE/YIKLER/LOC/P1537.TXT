   
   Drianshstitl (1537) is mostly flat, dry grassland, though is habitable
   enough (surface gravity 0.6 g, day length 27 hrs 41 mins,
   hydrographics percentage 14%, standard atmosphere). Public figures are
   not paid but can freely use House finances. However, they must pay for
   this with a total lack of privacy. Their homes must be open to any who
   wish to enter.
   
   In general, Drianshstitl is a back water world resentful of its lack
   of status. The three Houses who share the world have recently lobbied
   for greater voting power in the Izh Kriezhlal. It has become common
   for many people to use cosmetic based wetware to alter their moods
   and/or personalities to suit an occasion. A large "backyard" industry
   has grown in this area.

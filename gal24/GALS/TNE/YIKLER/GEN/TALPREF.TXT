The Gourmet Club

   There are small numbers of dark eccentrics on a number of worlds
   called the "Gourmet Club". These Talpaku particularly like human flesh
   and periodically kidnap humans (mostly Zhodani) for this purpose. The
   unfortunate victims are kept alive in order to provide fresh, raw meat
   at a feast, generally an elaborate affair. Some prefer specific
   sub-races of humaniti or even individual blood types.
   
   The organisation is too loose for authorities to stamp it out
   entirely. The authorities are also frustrated by the fact that it is
   quite easy for those with means to secretly obtain humans. At present,
   the media is voluntarily downplaying these events, in an attempt to
   stop other dark eccentrics being inspired to copy these crimes.
   Although this policy does appear to be working, it does have the
   unfortunate side effect that visitors are also unaware of the
   existence of the club.
   
Character Generation

   Talpaku characters should be generated as per normal rules, except
   that psionic ability and anagathics are not possible. Homeworld
   limited to one of the worlds of the Talpaku Communality or one of the
   nearby worlds stated as including Talpaku population.
   
   Roll up characteristics as normal, except:
   
   Classic Traveller: Subtract 1 from Strength (minimum 1). Gain DM of +1
   on any interpersonal die roll (excepting those involving Zhodani). Any
   career from the normal set and from Citizens of the Imperium is
   allowed. Rogues exist, but as members of street gangs and not as
   individuals.
   
   Megatraveller: As Classic Traveller. In addition, a bonus of 2 is
   gained for aging roll saving throws (since the Talpaku live longer
   than standard humans).
   
   TNE: Subtract 1 from Strength (minimum 1), add 1 to Charisma (maximum
   15). Any career from the normal set of careers is allowed (except that
   Psionic Researchers and Rebels require permission of the referee).
   Toughs exist, but as members of street gangs and not as individuals.
   In addition, a bonus of 2 is gained for aging roll saving throws.
   
   In addition, players may elect that their character is eccentric.
   Players choose a suitable, significant, eccentricity and also gain a
   significant advantage (perhaps a DM of +1 on rolls made involving a
   given characteristic). Both the eccentricity and advantage must be
   approved by the referee.
   
Roleplaying Talpaku

   Talpaku think that all Regency humans are like the people they met
   through the IISS, RISS and diplomatic services and rather like them.
   They think that Regency humans are great people and find them far
   nicer and more trustworthy than the Zhodani.
   
   Since musical scores and even holochips with critical information are
   so small, player characters could individually become significant on a
   trade level.
   
Overall Military Strategy

   The Talpaku are experimenting with warbots with prototype TL 15 power
   plants and energy weapons. These have average intelligence and hence
   are superior to Zhodani warbots. The Zhodani only know about the
   standard Talpaku TL 12/13 warbots, which are slightly inferior to
   their own designs, so the Talpaku hope to give the Zho a shock the
   next time around. They cannot make great numbers of these, but hope
   that deployment at a critical moment could turn the tide of battle.
   This could be the only thing where they are better than the Zho. A
   Virus outbreak amongst warbots would be horrific...
   
Talpaku Intentions

   Expansion: Now that the S'raak form a small buffer state between the
   Communality and the Zhodani, the Talpaku are again expansionist. The
   government sees such expansion, if handled properly, as a way of
   improving the economy and of improving the public perception of the
   government. At this stage, expansion into subsector M is most
   attractive, since there are some worlds there that the Communality
   would like to snap up before anyone else does. Otherwise, the
   Communality is looking into expansion into Tsadra sector. The S'raak
   Empire: It is true that much of the Talpaku military is tied up on the
   S'raak border, but this was the case before the S'raak War anyway
   (against the Zhodani). The Communality feels that it is strong enough
   to handle any future S'raak invasion, now that the S'raak advantage of
   surprise has been negated. It is the continuing annoyance of the tiny
   raids that cause a problem.
   
   The Communality does not particularly want any of the worlds of the
   S'raak Empire (most are less than ideal for Talpaku colonisation), but
   if the S'raak were to provide a reasonable excuse for the Talpaku to
   take a world or two from them, the Communality knows that this would
   be politically possible. Of course it is aware that this is true of
   the other states bordering the S'raak Empire, and so the Talpaku watch
   openings for the others very carefully.
   
   The Communality believes that the raids are more than just independent
   pirates, and is hoping to get information from captured pirates that
   point to S'raak or Zhodani involvement.
   
Language

   Talpaku words are translated into Galanglic in two ways. Some words
   are translated according to meaning, since the name carries meaning to
   the thing (e.g. Broken Promise, Firestar).
   
   Others are translated by the use of an artificial language, replacing
   particular whistles and clicks with letters. Such words can be
   generated as normal, rolling 1D for number of syllables and then
   generating each syllable by consulting the table.
   
   All vowels are short (as the "a" in "apple") and pronounced (unlike
   the "e" in "apple"). Most consonants are hard and need not be doubled.
   For instance, the sound "apple" would be spelt ("apl"). The only
   exceptions to the consonants rule are the breathed w, wh, hwh (each
   having more breath than the last) and ch (which is pronounced as in
   the Scottish loch). The kk initial consonant is not an exception - it
   is pronounced as two k's.

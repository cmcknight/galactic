-5500  Carillon reach TL 2
-5415  Zhodani discover jump drive
-5120  Zhodani discover Addaxur
-5110  Zhodani contact Addaxur

SECESSION OF THE MEICHNTID IBL

-5109  Meichntid Ibl founded, start of Shadow War. Secession at this time 
       succeeds because the Zho are not large enough to counter TL disadvantage
       with sheer numbers.
-5100  Zhodani scouts attempting to flank Meichntid Ibl discover Talpaku 
       homeworld and briefly observe Talpaku; Zhodani scout ship surveys 
       Carillon system. Flanking attempt abandoned since there is an effective
       3 pc barrier on the subsector E/I boundary (wilderness refuelling 
       impossible at 0421); Zhodani mount no further scouting missions. To 
       trailing, the Zhodani also enter Afachtiabr sector and contact 
       Vlazhdumecta.

At the end of this period, the Meichntid Ibl control much of subsectors B and C
and most of F and G. Shadow War going strong. Few Zho worlds; no other 
interstellar states exist.

       Afachtiabr sector; Carillon reach TL 3
-4900  Vlazhdumecta Empire collapse complete, link to Yiklerzdanzh colonies 
       abandoned, collapse of these colonies under way; Carillon discover 
       principles of their genetic code, sparking a technological explosion
-4800  Carillon reach effective TL 6
-4700  Carillon reach effective TL 8
-4650  Carillon fight civil war using biological weapons, Carillon thrown into 
       dark age

-4034  Zhodani lose interest in Yiklerzdanzh expansion after discovery that 
       projector device is accurate
-4000  Zhodani launch first Core Expedition

By the end of this period, the Vlazhdumecta Empire has long collapsed and their
Yiklerzdanzh colonies, also collapsed, are isolated The Meichntid Ibl have lost
some ground in the continuing Shadow War but are still a potent force. They do
not know that the Vlazhdumecta exist. Zhodani wish only to expand where
involved in the war effort with the Meichntid Ibl and some captured MI worlds.

RISE OF THE TALPAKU AND IZRATS KRIEZHLAS

-2700  Talpaku reach TL 10 (no jump drive) and trigger Zhodani interdiction 
       probe; Vlazhdumecta world (Qrazhazhjal) regains TL 9 and begins 
       reunification of Vlazhdumecta systems in Yiklerzdanzh
-2500  Vlazhdumecta systems in Yiklerzdanzh unify as the Izrats Kriezhlas
       Unity; Zhodani have reached TL 12
-2400  Zhodani survey ship recontacts Izrats Kriezlas Unity
-2280  Zhodani offer Vlazdumecta jump 2 and 3
-2000  Zhodani contact Vilani traders, Dzhagser Plague breaks out resulting in
       reduced Zhodani populations, Zhodani trade and communications routes to
       Trailing severely disrupted
-1792  Talpaku capture Zhodani trader, gain jump drive
-1750  Zhodani task force overwhelmed by Talpaku
-1685  First Talpaku War begins when Zhodani occupy Talpaku world. Talpaku 
       retake world and invade Zhodani Consulate. Meichntid Ibl astonished, as
       they "only patrol 4-5 pc and hence had not contacted the Talpaku". 
       Attempts to make contact for an alliance spurned (since they look like 
       Zhodani to the Talpaku); so they mount an independent offensive to
       regain some lost worlds. Talpaku offensive turned back after initial
       success and ceasefire called.
-1680  Zhodani begin serious survey of Yiklerzdanzh. Meichntid Ibl contact 
       Talpaku and explain things; Talpaku distrustful but enter into an 
       alliance.
-1600  Izrats Kriezhlas Unity covers 20 worlds and active on that many more. 
       They have been told about the Meichntid Ibl and Talpaku but decide 
       discretion is the better part of valour (for now, anyway).
-1595  Talpaku execute Zhodani diplomat after psionic incident, Second Talpaku
       War begins. Meichntid Ibl join in.
-1594  Second Talpaku War ends. Establishment of DMZ between Zhodani and 
       Talpaku. Meichntid Ibl lose many worlds.
-1400  Dzhagser plague strikes Zhodani again from Vargr space
-1300  Talpaku execute several Zhodani over psionic incidents, several 
       skirmishes occur, but war averted
-1230  First Izrats Kriezhlas Unity "Talpaku Mission" fails
-1000  Zhodani Consulate reaches present size, Dzhagser plague effectively
       under  control, Izrats Khriehlas Unity becomes a formal Zhodani client
       state.

By the end of this period, relative peace exists. The Shadow War has petered
out, but tensions exist between the Zhodani and the Meichntid Ibl/Talpaku 
alliance. The Zhodani have totally lost interest in expansion and just want 
secure borders. The Meichntid Ibl is roughly its present size. The Talpaku and
Carillon will have met, somewhere after -1500.

So here we are at the current date. Relations are only now beginning to settle
down after the SUraak War, and it will take a while before things settle down
totally (for instance, the full effects of the change in the Zhodani Relay
Route). Although full scale interstellar war seems unlikely at the moment,
border incidents and lower level conflicts still exist.

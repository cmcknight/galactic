Introduction

   Our long technological history has been intermittent, driven by
   different factors at different times. It also reflects the long period
   of isolation that has ended only in the last 900 years. The result are
   technologies that are sophisticated, but often not very compatible
   with equivalents developed by other cultures. This means that many of
   our items can only be repaired on their own worlds. The main
   exceptions are the jump drive and certain other starship related
   technologies, since these were obtained from the Zhodani and follow
   Zhodani design principles.
   
   About 80% of our existing military and civilian starships, vehicles
   and robots range from TL 11-12. The remaining 20% of civilian designs
   are pre TL 11, though TL 13 designs have reached the mass production
   stage in the last few years. The remaining 20% of military designs are
   split 15% pre TL 11 and 5% TL 13 designs. In all cases, power plants
   can be one TL higher than the rest of the design, thanks to our
   proficiency in this area.
   
Starships

   Civilian starships range from 100 tons to about 25000 tons. A handful
   of larger ships exists in private hands, but the occasional needs for
   huge vessels are satisfied only by leasing military transports.
   
   Military starships range from 100 tons to 100,000 tons. We prefer to
   have greater numbers of smaller craft than small numbers of huge
   craft. We use planetoids of all sizes for system defense; many are
   just hollowed out planetoids armed with missile launchers and without
   even a manoeuvre drive.
   
   A few military non-starships (buffered planetoid designs) exist that
   are larger than 100,000 tons.
   
   Both military and civilian designs are long and angular, following the
   original Zhodani influence. Interior design is also similar to Zhodani
   design, except for living quarters; these are open space, with
   communal sleeping quarters. There are some small cubicles for study
   and meditation. The total space used for accommodation is the same as
   human designs.
   
   Outside the Communality, weapons are powered down only for the first 5
   days in jump space or when in starports felt to be particularly safe.
   Within the Communality, weapons are powered down permanently. We do
   not venture outside the Communality with weapons powered down, as we
   fear that even the short time to warm start could be our undoing. We
   have no particular preference for battle power plants, but it is
   sometimes necessary when more power is needed and there is
   insufficient space in the power plant room to install a larger power
   plant.
   
  Katwha Type A Free Trader
  
   Craft ID:Talpaku Katwha Free Trader, Type A, TL 12, MCr 36.781
   (including 20% discount) Hull:180/450, Disp=200, Config=1SL,

   Other:Cargo=1140 kl, Fuel=468 kl, PurificationPlant (14 hours),
   ObjSize=Average, EmLevel=Faint
   
   The Katwha class Free Trader is designed to carry cargo and passengers
   from one end of the Communality to the other. Most owners do not
   bother with weapons (since piracy is rare and resistance of military
   vessels is futile), though some add sandcaster or missile turrets.
   Some spare space has been allocated to the bridge to allow for control
   panel units for any weapons which may later be added. Double occupancy
   of crew is not required unless gunners are present.
   
   Energy weapons are harder to install, for there is far less spare
   power for even a single laser turret. It is not possible to enlarge
   the existing power plant, so it is necessary to convert the low berth
   room or some cargo space into an auxiliary power plant room.
   
   There is a cargo-only variant of the Katwha which has only three
   staterooms, no low berths, no steward, cargo 1599 kl, loaded weight
   3178 tons and discounted cost MCr 34.301.
   
   All Katwha class vessels have names starting with a "K".
   
  Kzodazdak Type A2 Free Trader
   
   The Kzodazdak class Far Trader is mainly used to carry cargo and
   passengers within the Communality, though it is also used to trade
   with the Zhodani Consulate and the Meichntid Ibl. It differs from the
   Katwha in that it has jump-2, 368 dynamically linked panels, 8
   staterooms, Purification Plant (22 hours), 950 kl cargo, loaded weight
   1914.265 tons, discounted cost MCr 40.99.
   
   The cargo-only variant of the Kzodazdak has three staterooms, no low
   berths, no steward, cargo 1302 kl, loaded weight 2263.265 tons and
   discounted cost MCr 39.153.
   
   All Kzodazdak class vessels have names starting with a "Kz".
   
  Zdayok Type A2 Free Trader
  
   Craft ID:Talpaku Zdayok Trader, Type A2, TL 12, MCr 89.2 (including
   20% discount) Hull:360/900, Disp=400, Config=1SL, Armour=40F,
   Unloaded=3022 tons, Loaded=6177 tons Power:11/22, Fusion=1485 Mw (TL
   13), Duration=30/90 Loco:8/16, Maneuver-1, 11/22, Jump-2, NOE=160 kph,
   Cruise=750 kph, Top=1000 kph, Agility=0 Commo:Radio=System Sensors:EMS
   Passive=Interstellar, EMS Active=Far Orbit, ActObjScan=Rout,
   ActObjPin=Rout, PasEngScan=Rout Off/Def:Hardpoints=4, BeamLaser= x02
   (Batt 001, Bear 001), Missiles= x02 (Batt 001, Bear 001) Def:DefDM=+3
   Control:Computer=1x3, Panel=Dyn Link x 691, Special=HeadsUpx3,
   Environ=Basic Env, Basic LS, Extended LS, Grav Plates, Inertial Comp
   Accom:Crew=5 (Bridge=2, Engineer=1, Gunners=2), "Staterooms"=4,
   LowBerths=6 Other:Cargo=3117 kl, Fuel=936 kl, PurificationPlant (22.5
   hours), HE Missile magazine=12, ObjSize=Average, EmLevel=Faint
   
   The Zdayok class Trader is mainly used for trade outside the
   Communality. It is sometimes found in the hands of a single-ship small
   company, but is usually owned and operated by a takh or small company
   which owns several ships.
   
   There are two spare hardpoints, so extra weapons can be installed if
   desired. To do this, the low berth room or some cargo space must be
   converted into an auxiliary power plant room. Spare space has been
   allocated to the bridge to allow for the associated extra control
   panel units. The extra two gunners can be accommodated by everyone
   being in double occupancy.
   
   All Zdayok class vessels have names starting with "Zd".
   
  Hwhibuhwha Type J Interplanetary Seeker
   
   Craft ID:Talpaku Hwhibuhwha Seeker, Type J, TL 12, MCr 15 (including
   20% discount) Hull:63/158, Disp=70, Config=2SL, Armour=40F,
   Unloaded=580 tons, Loaded=1156 tons Power:3/6, Fusion=414 Mw (TL 13),
   Duration=60/180 Loco:1/2, Maneuver-1, NOE=n/a, Cruise=750 kph,
   Top=1000 kph, Vacuum=1200, Agility=0/2* Commo:Radio=Far Orbit
   Sensors:EMS Passive=Interplanetary, EMS Active=Far Orbit, Densitometer
   High Pen/50m, 2 heavy robotic arms, ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout,
   PasObjScan=Diff, PasObjPin=Diff, PasEngScan=Rout Off/Def:Hardpoints=1,
   PulseLaser=x01 (Batt 001, Bear 001) Def:DefDM=+2/+3*
   Control:Computer=0/bisx3, Panel=Dyn Link x70,
   Special=LargeHoloDisplay, Environ=Basic Env, Basic LS, Extended LS,
   Grav Plates, Inertial Comp, Air Lock Accom:Crew=1 (Bridge=1),
   "Staterooms"=1 Other:Cargo=564.7 kl, Fuel=163.2 kl, ObjSize=Average,
   EmLevel=Faint
   
   The Hwhibuhwha class Interplanetary Seeker is often found in systems
   with rich belts that can sustain a permanent belter population (and so
   vessels do not need a jump drive). The pulse laser is used only for
   carving up planetoids, so the power plant is powered down most of the
   time (the duration stated provides for 240 hours use of the laser).
   Stats marked with a * are affected by power plant status (e.g. agility
   0 when powered up, 2 when powered down). Obviously, the laser can be
   used for combat purposes when necessary.
   
   Although the craft can be operated by a single person, a crew of 2 is
   more usual. This prevents loneliness and makes it more feasible that
   the necessary skills are well represented. Occasionally, these craft
   are found with a crew of 4, with each person specialising in some
   required skill and allowing 24 hour operation of the prospecting
   mission.
   
   When used with a Tetukuv mining habitat, these craft have scoops
   added.
   
  Tetukov Type PW Mining Habitat
   
   Craft ID:Talpaku Tetukov Seeker, Type PW, TL 12, MCr 76.865 (including
   20% discount) Hull:540/1350, Disp=600, Config=8USL, Armour=45,
   Unloaded=3942 tons, Loaded=5691 tons Power:8/16, Fusion=1080 Mw (TL
   13), Duration=30 Loco:11/22, Maneuver-1, NOE=n/a, Cruise=750 kph,
   Top=1000 kph, Vacuum=1200, Agility=0 Commo:Radio=Far Orbitx2
   Sensors:EMS Passive=Interplanetary, EMS Active=Far Orbit, 4 heavy
   robotic arms, ActObjScan=Rout, ActObjPin=Rout, PasEngScan=Rout
   Off/Def:Hardpoints=6 Def:DefDM=+1 Control:Computer=0/bisx3, Panel=Dyn
   Link x714, Special=LargeHoloDisplayx2, Environ=Basic Env, Basic LS,
   Extended LS, Grav Plates, Inertial Comp, Air Lockx4 Accom:Crew=4
   (Bridge=2, Engineering=1, Medic=1), "Staterooms"=45, "MidPsg"=56,
   EmergLowBerth, SubCraft=Interplanetary Seekersx2 Other:Cargo=1719 kl,
   Fuel=432 kl, Purification Plant (51.8 hours), ObjSize=Average,
   EmLevel=Moderate/Faint (powered up/down)
   
   The Tetukov class mining habitat is mostly used by communes which wish
   to live in a planetoid belt, living a belter lifestyle. It is also
   used by larger companies.
   
   The duration assumes that the manoeuvre drive is used for only 5 days
   (i.e. to travel to and from the planetoid belt and otherwise used only
   for occasional orbital adjustments). The duration can be extended
   indefinitely if one of the carried subcraft (c.f. Hwhibuhwha class
   Interplanetary Seeker) is fitted with scoops and is sent on occasional
   missions to a gas giant to gather fuel (purification is done upon
   return).
   
   The craft needs only 4 crew but allows for a permanent population of
   60 Talpaku. The 45 "Staterooms" represent space for immediate living
   quarters and also areas needed for residents of all ages (e.g. general
   entertainment, education, fitness and medical facilities). One of the
   spare computers is used for entertainment and education unless needed
   by an emergency.
   
   The robotic arms are used in the cargo bay. The emergency low berth is
   for medical use. No provision for environment controls are made in the
   cargo, fuel and subcraft areas (not even grav plates). The air locks
   are used for access to the cargo bay (1), the subcraft (2) and the
   outside (1).
   
   There is a variant of this craft without a manoeuvre drive. These are
   bases, rather than craft, and must be moved by a tug or similar
   vessel.
   
   The Talpaku Communality stations military bases in belts which
   superficially resemble these habitats. The military bases are armed
   with missiles, energy weapons and/or fighters and are used for
   surprise attacks during invasions by such external threats as the
   Zhodani. Power plants are powered down to resemble the profile of a
   real Tetukov mining habitat and only a Passive Object Pinpoint from a
   densitometer will reveal the true nature of the craft. The minimum
   size of a prospecting claim is far greater than the maximum range of a
   densitometer, so the stations are normally safe from such detection.
   If a civilian craft does close to TL 15 densitometer range of a
   station, some crews will fire to protect their secret, even though
   this is technically against orders. It should be noted that an
   advantage of contact with the Imperium was that the Talpaku now know
   the ranges of many Zhodani sensors.
   
   It is sometimes said that trigger-happy prospectors who attack those
   who intrude on their claim space are not prosecuted as strongly as
   they should. This allows the military to cover up the occasional
   shooting by claiming that the victim was actually attacked by a
   trigger-happy civilian and it was not them at all.
   
Vehicles

   Vehicles are prolific in our decentralised society. All vehicles
   include computers, providing such features as navigational assistance,
   proximity alerts and cruise control at a minimum. All airborne
   vehicles can be controlled remotely, by the owner or by a traffic
   control computer.
   
   In the larger settlements of some worlds (e.g. Talpakuhome), traffic
   density makes central traffic control the only safe option. Most of us
   prefer traffic control computers anyway, since this allows us to
   concentrate on conversations with other passengers, listening to
   music, doing hobbies or work, or putting our makeup on.
   
   Vehicle design is similar to that of humans, but there are some
   differences:
     * Accommodation need be doubled only if journeys of more than 9
       hours are expected.
     * Extended accommodations need only be provided if journeys of more
       than 9 hours are expected.
     * Civilian vehicles usually have "adequate" or "roomy" interiors,
       since this better allows the occupants to amuse themselves on
       journeys.
     * Basic life support is common in vehicle designs intended for the
       whole Communality, since only two of our worlds have breathable
       atmospheres. This allows us to remove compressors and filters for
       journeys.
     * Robot brains are often found in "deluxe" versions of longer-range
       vehicles, though these are only about skill level 1 or 2 and
       cannot handle extreme terrain or weather conditions.
       
  Kuzda Air/Raft
  
   Craft ID:Talpaku Kuzda Air/Raft, TL 12, Cr 713,085 Hull:2/5, Disp=2,
   Config=1SL, Armour=4F, Unloaded=6.3 tons, Loaded=6.8 tons Power:1/2,
   Fusion=2Mw (TL 13), Duration=15/45 Loco:1/2, Low Power H-Grav,
   Thrust=12 tons, NOE=160 kph, Cruise=675 kph, Top=900 kph,
   MaxAccel=0.75G Commo:Radio=Continental(5000km) Sensors:All Weather
   Radar=VDist (50 km), Synthetic Vision, ActObjScan=Diff, ActObjPin=Diff
   Off/Def:None Control:Computer=0x2, Dyn Link Accom:Crew=1 (operator),
   Seats=Roomyx5, Adequatex1, Env=Basic Env, Ext ls, inertial comp
   Other:Fuel=1.8 kl, Cargo=.442 kl, ObjSize=Small, EmLevel=Faint,
   LtRobotArmx2
   
   The Kuzda air/raft is a typical vehicle owned by those who live in
   outlying communities but must commute to larger settlements on a
   regular basis. Although the design assumes routine journeys will not
   exceed 9 hours, the speed of the vehicle makes most destinations
   accessible in this time. Due to the cost, this vehicle is sometimes
   purchased by a commune rather than an individual.
   
   Extended life support is provided for convenience and also to allow
   the owner the option of using the vehicle for journeys of more than 9
   hours (this has no effect on performance except to reduce the maximum
   number of passengers).
   
   The first robot arm is in the cargo compartment and loads baggage. The
   second is in the cabin and performs basic steward functions.
   
   In deluxe models, such as those produced by my own company
   Kiplkhewhawhe, a robot brain replaces the primary computer: CPU=11
   linear, 10 parallel, 1 synaptic, Storage=30 standard, FundLogic=Low
   Autonomous, FundCmd=Full Command, Software=Grav Vehicle-1, Steward-1.
   Extra cost Cr 108,700.
   
Robots

   Robots have normally been used to replace manual labour rather than
   tasks involving intelligence; this tendency has increased, thanks to
   Virus. For efficiency, manual worker robots are found in groups, where
   one is a master robot and the rest are brainless slave robots. The
   master robot itself can be controlled remotely by radio.
   
   When a robot has need for "cargo space" (to carry tools, ore samples
   or the like), we instinctively place it in the lower torso, rather
   like a pouch.
   
   Robots are open-frame unless the environment in which they work makes
   enclosure necessary (as is the case with the sampler robot below).
   Unlike human society, open frame robots are quite acceptable (and
   cheaper, too!). Their owners sometimes like the incongruity of an open
   frame robot adorned with a feathered cap or scarf.
   
   We have no need to anthropomorphise our robots and would not bother
   with pseudo-biological types, even if we could build them.
   
  Yatikiki Biological Sampler Robot
  
   RobotID:Talpaku Yatikiki Biological Sampler Robot, TL 12, Cr 246,925,
   UPP LAx54x (Strength L=20) Hull:14/35, Size=350 litres, Config=2,
   Armour=2A, Weight=300 kg Power:5/10,FuelCell=75 kw (TL 13),
   Duration=180 hours Loco:1/2, 2 legs, Speed=3
   Commo:Radio=Regional(500km) Sensors:Visualx2 (with light intensifier
   and passive IR), Touchx2 (extra sensitivity), Olfactory (extra
   sensitivity), Audiox2 (extra sensitivity), Taste, Video Recorder 2D,
   Spotlight Off:Snub Pistol (with tranq) Def:None Brain:CPU=19 linear,
   10 parallel, 2 synaptic, Storage=36 standard, FundLogic=Low
   Autonomous, FundCmd=Basic Command, Software=Biology-3, Close Combat-1,
   Hunting-2, Snub Pistol-1, Recon-2 Append:Light Armx2 Other:Fuel=54
   litres, Cargo=29 litres, ObjSize=Tiny, EmLevel=Faint
   
   A more interesting type of Talpaku robot is the Yatikiki Biological
   Sampler Robot. Our complex nutritional needs can make colonies very
   reliant on foodstuffs imported from offworld, so it is important to
   make the most use of the biospheres of all our worlds. This robot is
   designed to go about the wilderness, looking for plants and small
   animals. The robot can be instructed to search for any new organism,
   or given particular criteria to use in searching.
   
   Biological surveys normally make robots responsible for different
   areas within the survey region. Each robot is dropped into the centre
   of its area, together with a refrigeration unit and hydrogen gas tank.
   From its base, each robot makes numerous field trips, progressively
   covering the surrounding area. The inbuilt radio is used when the
   mission is complete or when some pre-designated situation occurs.
   
   The video recorder can be replaced by a video camera, which transmits
   video images back to the mission supervisor. Another version has a
   half normal size fuel tank, allowing extra storage space.
   
   There are apocryphal stories of sampler robots capturing Zhodani
   spies, mistaking them for wildlife.

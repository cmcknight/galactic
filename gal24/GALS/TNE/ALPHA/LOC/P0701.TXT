        Previously a refuelling stop for traders along the Antraillian
Main, Kazan lost over 95% of its population in a Vampire raid which
literally bombed it back into the stone age. Kazan quickly degenerated
into chaos and lawlessness as the remaining people struggled desperately
to survive. Eventually, the dictator Samark managed to restore order 
and began the arduous task of rebuilding a technological society. However,
upon his death rival lieutenants struggled for power, plunging Kazan back 
into chaos again and destroying all that Samark had struggled for. The
planet was only reunited again in 1189, by one of the great dictator's many
grandsons. Unfortunately, the new ruler is more in the mold of a classic
TED than his illustrious forebear, using his superior TL-5 weaponry to 
maintain his power over the struggling peasants.

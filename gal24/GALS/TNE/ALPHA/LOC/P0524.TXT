Today, the descendents of the surviving Knights have reconstituted
the Order with their headquarters on Bali. Still adhering to rigorous
religious schooling of the past, their role as warriors has been
diminished (though not completely eliminated) in favor of one that
includes training the inhabitants of the subsector in the ways of relic
technology, and assisting wherever possible with the subsector's
recovery. The Knights operate a number of small starships which they
use to travel through out the surrounding region.

In addition to being the location of the headquarters of the Knights
of St. George, Bali is also a regional trading center, frequented by
free traders, and recently, merchants from the Lamarck and Jorjor
systems in the Solomani Rim sector.

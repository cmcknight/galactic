
Assiniboia C755794-9      

Colonists from North America, predominately Canada and Mexico settled
this subsector during the Rule of Man. Relatively sparsely populated,
the subsector was a haven for pirates causing interstellar trade to
suffer in this region until the Solomani Navy established a strong
presence here in the early 1100s. With the Solomani invasion of the
Imperium in 1117, the Navy left, and the pirates returned. By 1130,
naval vessels returning from the war attempted to restore order, using
Assiniboia as a base of operations. The Collapse occurred before any
serious campaign of pirate suppression could be mounted.

Today Assiniboia is the site of an interstellar revival. An agricultural
world, its starport and naval base managed through a combination of fate
and blind luck to survive the initial Virus waves relatively unscathed.
Assiniboia scout ships and naval vessels have explored the coreward
portions of the subsector, along with the jump-1 main that makes up the
heart of the sector. To date, they have found no other interstellar
states, a few wandering free traders, and only a handful of Vampire ships
that were quickly exterminated in a series of three battles (Veracruz,
Selkirk, and Livonia). The government of Assiniboia has decided to
dedicate a large portion of its budget toward funding expeditions to
recover relic technology from surrounding worlds with the eventual
goal of increasing the world's tech level so that new starships can be
constructed. As Assiniboia doesn't have much in the way of an Army or
Marine forces (total planetary population is about 15.6 million in 1202),
these expeditions are likely to be uninhabited worlds, where there is no
problem with local forces resisting salvaging operations.

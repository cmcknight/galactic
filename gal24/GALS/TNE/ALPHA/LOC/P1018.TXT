
Freiwelt (1018) is not a full member of the Beltan Empire - only the 
nation of Arcadia. It is currently fighting the Purity Front for planetary 
dominance - and with the huge influx of aid since it joined the 
Empire in 1200 it has been slowly but steadily winning the battle.

Nation UWPs are: Arcadia  D657746-9 M         Pm:8
                 Purity   E6578AF-5           Pm:2

Other minor nations are either in the Purity Front, or the Arcadian
League.

The Military base is operated by the Empire, and supports both Arcadia 
and forward based Naval units. It also has a comprehensive ABM network
to protect Arcadia against nuclear attack.

Purity has been forced to look for outside aid, and Kranak had provided
some TL-9 equipment in exchange for relic equipment.

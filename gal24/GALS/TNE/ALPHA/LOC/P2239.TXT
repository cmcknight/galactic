
Eldritch E8487Q3-8       

Eldritch was formerly an agricultural colony of Connemara (2439), and had 
been fighting to free itself for some time. The Connemaran occupation 
forces surrendered soon after the Collapse, and the planet is now 
ruled by an oligarchic "revolutionary council". The descendents of 
the Connemaran garrison have recently begun pushing for permission to 
resettle their now-barren homeworld.

        Even colder than Leng, Graff's terrain is split between
utterly dry and barren plains and uplands and deep, ice-covered 
"crater-seas". The depths of these seas are warmed in places by 
tectonic activity, which has led to some small oases of life on the
otherwise barren world. The atmospheric taint is mostly sulphur 
compounds spewed into the air by volcanoes, though the extremely
low atmospheric moisture level also contributes to its unbreathability.

        Before the Collapse, Graff was a fairly standard F-Tech world,
its population of seven million living in both undersea and underground
habitats. Several species of oasis-life were farmed and herded, and traded
to other worlds in exchange for high-tech manufactured goods. Prior warning 
of the Virus led to most of the cities totally severing their data links 
before they were infected, thus the Collapse did not wreak its full 
horrors on Graff. However, several of the the surface settlements were
invaded by Virus, and the news (carried by a few refugees) underscored 
the dangers of communication. Graff is only just beginning to recover from
its retreat into isolationism, the cities only recently having joined 
together to form a planetary government along federal lines. The various 
communities govern themselves in their own manner (usually some form of
democratic government), and provide representatives for a planetary
concillium. As a hold-over from the previous F-Tech constitution most 
councillers are selected on the basis of their expertise, rather than
being popularly elected. There are no organised political parties in
the planetary government, though there is an informal division between 
"progressives", who favour limited interstellar contact, and 
"conservatives", who point to the horrors of the Collapse as an 
illustration of the dangers of such contact. The current consensus is 
slightly progressive - thus, the starport remains open, and the small
planetary navy (a scout and a converted fat trader, neither jump capable)
does not warn ships away.


Fairday X100000-0

With a former population of 80 billion and a TL of 14, it is assured that
Fairday (1303) has a substantial number of relic artifacts that could
be salvaged. However, it is also highly probable that a strong Virus
presence resides in system, maybe in the form of non-jump capable ships
and vehicles.

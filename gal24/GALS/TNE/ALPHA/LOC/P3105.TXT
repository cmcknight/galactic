---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Arwen (3105) should have died in the Collapse, but with plenty of sacrifice
and hard work by its citizens, not to mention the assistance of its sister
worlds in the Protectorate of Alba, it managed to survive.

Arwen is a battered lifeless moon, orbiting a world, much like Venus, where
the greenhouse effect has raised the temperature to over 800 degrees
Celcius, and acid rains down on the surface.

The citizens of Arwen live in cities of connected pressurized buildings
along the rims of craters. Several of these cities failed during the
collapse, not because of the Virus, but due to lack of critical parts. The
rest of the cities were kept alive by spare parts scavenged from the rest
of the Protectorate.

Life is very harsh in the craters, anything which could possibly endanger
the public, is outlawed, and harshly punished with long sentences to hard
labor.

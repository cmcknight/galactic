HISTORY:

        Umkarguu is an ethinicly Vilani world, originally settled during
the Ziru Sirka. A coup during the Solomani Rim War replaced the (ethnically 
Solomani) governing class with a pro-Imperial popular dictatorship, which
was in turn overthrown during the Second Rim War. However, the military 
government imposed by the Solomani effectively dissolved in the Collapse.
In the chaos that followed, the population turned to religion in search of 
a reason or purpose for the destruction. The traditional religious 
groupings, adapted to a placid society, were quickly replaced by new and
more aggressive groups - many of which were techno- or xenophobic. 

        Seventy years on, religion is still the dominant force in Umkargaan
society. Most states are out and out theocracies, and political parties
tend to be organised on religious lines in the remainder. Many nations
legislate a state religion, while others are forced to enact strict laws in 
order to keep the lid on religious conflict. Intolerance and persecution of 
religious minorities is rife.

DEMOGRAPHICS:

        The population is entirely human, and speak several distant 
derivitives of Vilani, thus local interpreters will likely be required. 
Global population has actually increased since the collapse, with 
most of the growth occuring in Umkakuur.

TECHNO-POLITICO-MILITARY:

        Umkarguu's sustainable tech-level is 5, with limited TL-6 
equipment available in the larger and more advanced nations 
(Shasugku, Khari and Amkakhur). There is no relic technology in use 
on the planet, though the Guild has recently begun selling 
higher-tech military hardware to various nations. All nations 
maintain large military and internal security forces.

        The world's major continent is shared by both Shasugku and 
Umkakuur, who are currently engaged in a religious war which has also 
embroiled most of their smaller neighbours. Another continent holds 
Kasiguurdi, whose allies Gishshi and Laligbaar share a third with Khari.
Amkakhur is a relatively isolated archapeligo.

ADVENTURE IDEAS:

Intel - Gather intelligence on Guild activities on Umkarguu
      - Word has reached the RC that Shasugku is working on an atomic 
        weapons programme. Given their current war with Umkakuur, it 
        is almost certain that such weapons, if they were to be 
        developed, would be used. Infiltrate the weapons programme 
        and identify the key researchers involved.

Hot recovery - kidnap the key researchers involved in the Shasugkuuan
               atomic programme.
             - A Guild ship has crashed in Umkakuur while making a 
               weapons delivery. Investigate the crash, and capture 
               any survivors for interrogation.

Negotiation - Accompany an RC representative to Miseki (currently at 
              war with Amishkaani) and aassist her in negotiating a 
              trade and technical assistance treaty (conditional on 
              ceasing involvement in the Shasugkuuan-Umkakuuran war)
            - Khari, Laligbaar and Gishshi currently exist in an 
              uneasy state of peace which threatens to descend into 
              war at any moment. Such a war would activate defence 
              treaties and thus involve Kasiguurdi and Amkakhur as 
              well. Accompany an RC negotiation team and assist them in 
              brokering a stable(r) peace or a disarmament treaty 
              between the parties involved.

Bootstrap - Assist an RC technological assistance team in Miseki

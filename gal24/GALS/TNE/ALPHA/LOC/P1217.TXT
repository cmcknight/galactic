Sarmqir was an important industrial world before the Collapse, all its
inhabitants perished when their life support shut off. It's defences will
fire at any ship approaching the mainworld, which ironically means that it
defends Beltan from attack from that direction. Beaconed fuel dumps on the
edge of the inner system allow movement out of the system.

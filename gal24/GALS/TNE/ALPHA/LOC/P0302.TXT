        Etienne is a large world with a thin (0.65 Atm) atmosphere 
and roughly 70% water coverage. It's proximity to the system primary 
results in a hot (~50 C) climate, with seasonal effects caused by 
the world's extreme orbital eccentricity (0.2) rather than its minimal 
axial tilt. The local day and year are both "short", at 11.85 std hours 
and 43.27 std days respectively. The atmospheric "taint" is a low partial
pressure of oxygen, requiring either compressor masks or a long period of
acclimatization.

        Etienne was only settled relatively recently; thus it's 
pre-Collapse population numbered only 2000, centered around Etienne 
Down starport near the world's north pole. The inhabitants - 
consisting of starport staff, independent prospectors, and xenological 
researchers, as well as a few "real" settlers - governed themselves by 
means of a small directly elected "town council" which enacted strict 
laws in order to protect Etienne's native ecosystem.

        The world was little affected by either the second Rim War or 
the Hard Times that followed it; however, during the Collapse it was 
literally inundated with refugees from neighbouring Wulfe - nearly 
three hundred thousand people in all. This overwhelmed the planetary 
infrastructure, leading to famine and the total breakdown of law and 
order. The problem was compounded when a passing Vampire ship 
bombarded the starport and the adjacent settlement, causing massive 
casualties and contaminating most of the agricultural land with 
fallout. 

        Seventy years on, the population of Etienne is almost able 
to feed itself, though only by constant struggle. Due to the 
biological differences between native and imported ecosystems, dietry 
deficiencies are rife and life expectancy is thus low. The high-minded 
ideals of the original colonists have been thrust aside in favour of 
ruthless exploitation of whatever resources are necessary for survival.
                                                      
        Etienne is currently governed by a religious group which 
preaches that man sinned by leaving his appointed place in the universe 
(Terra) and that the Collapse was god's punishment for humaniti's 
violation of the Natural Order. The church is extremely xenophobic 
and technophobic; its rise to power was due mainly to its superior 
ability to organise and a wide streak of ruthlessness.

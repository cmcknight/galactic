The survivors of the Collapse on Ramadan actually claim to have
experienced an enhancement in their quality of life. Prior to the coming
of Virus, this system was governed by a cruel theocrat named Mojo Saud.
Saud was a ruthless and paranoid dictator, infamous for having many
members of his cabinet and officer corps executed if he perceived even the
slightest hint of treasonous thought from them. Attempted coups were
frequent, owing to the oppressiveness of the regime. Oftentimes 'evidence'
of treasonous thought consisted of a facial expression Saud did not like
or even just an expressed need for 'new blood' in his military and
political junta. 

The fury of Virus caused the deaths of some 25 billion Ramadani.
Unprotected exposure to the planet9s carbon monoxide atmospheric taint and
civil war caused the deaths of another six billion. The remaining
inhabitants, some 262 million people, are now governed by a significantly
less draconian dictator, but the Ramadani, three generations removed from
the corrupt Saud government, are not likely to forget the lessons of their
history.

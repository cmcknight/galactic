
Blenkinsop (1119) is another world under the aegis of Beltan. The state 
of Yellain provides support for Beltanian traffic through the system, 
and Beltan provides security. The other state on Blenkinsop is the 
Gostners - sea gypsies who trade fish and edible kelp with Yellain in 
return for maintenance. Yellain is trying to incorporate them into their 
government - but has met with only hostility. The starport is minor, all 
the planet produces of worth is pharmaceutical and chemical extracts. It 
was incorporated into the Empire in 1182.

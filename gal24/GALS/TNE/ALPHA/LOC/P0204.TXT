        A lawless frontier world before the collapse, Kedin's population
has shrunk and its people live a low-tech existence. Most of the
inhabitants are subsistance farmers, clustered in small settlements near 
the old starport. The settlements are democraticly governed, and each sends
a representative to a council which resolves intersettlement disputes. In 
practice, this council is a powerless forum for debate, rather than a true
"planetary government".

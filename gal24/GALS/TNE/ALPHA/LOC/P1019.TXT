
Werldt (1019) fell hard in the collapse, but was such a hospitable world 
that more than 50% of the population were able to survive the devastation. 
The Empire's forces deposed the TED of Balash, Bakarish Nefud, after a 
Beltanian Merchant was destroyed by missile fire from his realm in 1185.
Nefud escaped to the wilderness of the Untended Zones on the Continent of 
Pavanne. Here, amongst the ruins of 'Grain King' harvesters and wild 
crops he plots his revenge. Minor states have been allowed their 
independence - as long as they recognise Beltan's position as their 
protector. The infusion of Beltan's expertise has raised the tech level 
of Balash by five points, and a starport has been constructed on Balash's 
western coast. Balash is now operated as a Feudal Technocracy by Nefud's 
former 'Technical Guard' Commanders. Exploitation of Werldt's mineral 
resources has begun, as has the mining of the system's two asteroid belts. 
Arcadia has laid claim to Werldt as a former colony, but the Beltan System 
Governor has told them the question will be deferred until Freiwelt has 
a unified government.

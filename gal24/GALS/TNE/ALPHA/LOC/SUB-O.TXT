Subsector Notes
---------------

The vast majority of the surviving population in New Holland Subsector
are members of non-human minor race on Narnia. The best starport is the
C-class facility at Tilburg.
 
The trailing part of the subsector was settled during the Rule of Man 
by people of Dutch extraction, and prior to the Collapse formed a 
loose union of worlds known as the Waal Confederation (after it's 
economic powerhouse and capital). The inhabitants of these worlds 
still speak a derivitave of Dutch, with a bit of Anglic thrown in.

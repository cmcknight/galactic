
Colfax D654200-8          

The population of Colfax (1605) is made up of the descendants of the
survivors of the Imperial Scout base and the descendants of the survivors
of a Solomani cruiser that crashed here in 1135. The population has worked
together for years to maintain the scout base, and they offer some support
to Free Traders passing through. They see this as their vigil guarding a
fragment of a lost civilization. How they will respond to finding that
flame rekindled in the Old Expanses is anybody's guess.

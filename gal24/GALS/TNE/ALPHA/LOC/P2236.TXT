
Narnia X5599T4-6          

Narnia was interdicted by the Solomani confederation owing to it's 
being the home of a non-human minor race; it was thus untouched by the 
Collapse. Since then both the population and tech-level have 
increased, the former to dangerous levels. The Narnians have also 
begun a space program, and have discovered the surveillance 
satellites left in orbit by the Solomani.

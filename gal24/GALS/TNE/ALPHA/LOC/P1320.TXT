
Clerkson's (1320) balkanisation is due to the fact that it's two major 
industries were Starport support and Hunting. Solomani Party member would 
vacation there to hunt the fast and vicious beasts of it's one continent. 
The Island Starport was there mainly to facilitate this. With the collapse 
the Starport was damaged, but not destroyed. Two 'nations' sprung up - 
the 'RealMen' and the 'Porters'. Interaction was amicable enough - Realmen 
traded food and furs for the Porter's manufactured goods. With entry into 
the Empire the port was upgraded. The increasing liberalisation of Beltan 
has also led to more immigration - mainly to the Realmen. Trade through the 
port has increased exponentially in the last two years. Most traders prefer 
to trade with Assinibola through Clerkson and Mafeking, rather than jumping 
through Agryx and Leiby. It will only be a matter of time before the 
starport is upgraded to 'C' class. Mineralogical studies are underway to 
locate the rare ores known to exist here.

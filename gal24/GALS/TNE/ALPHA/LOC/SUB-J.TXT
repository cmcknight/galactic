Subsector Notes
---------------

Colonists from North America, predominately Canada and Mexico settled
this subsector during the Rule of Man. Relatively sparsely populated,
the subsector was a haven for pirates causing interstellar trade to
suffer in this region until the Solomani Navy established a strong
presence here in the early 1100s. With the Solomani invasion of the
Imperium in 1117, the Navy left, and the pirates returned. By 1130,
naval vessels returning from the war attempted to restore order, using
Assiniboia as a base of operations. The Collapse occurred before any
serious campaign of pirate suppression could be mounted.


The population of Yubitty (0313) suffers under the oppression of an
autocratic dictator who took control after the Collapse. The dictator
assumed authority under the pretense that his plan to protect the people of
the Yubitty system was their only hope for salvation. He has instituted
complete authority over the use of technology and maintains it with an iron
fist. Simple conveniences like running water and power for electric light
are meticulously regulated by the government. Violations of the law are
punished severely in all cases. In the last decade, a growing resistance
has begun to make steps toward overthrowing the government. Striking from
salvaged nomadic sea trawlers, the resistance has proven they are a major
thorn in the side of this horribly draconian regime.

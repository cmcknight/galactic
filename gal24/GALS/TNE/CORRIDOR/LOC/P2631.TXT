
Before the Collapse, the IISS base at Umaraag (2631) had begun legal
proceedings against the Naval base at Sumeszu (2632). Naval medics from
nearby Umaraag took 120 chirpers for research purposes from a reserve on
Umaraag, where chirpers comprise over 60% of the population. Scout
personnel maintained that such action violated the laws protecting the
reservation and the chirper's right to live unmolested. Initial ruling in
1114 favored the Navy, and the Scouts subsequently appealed the decision.
The policies of the "real Strephon," favoring equal treatment of both
natural and artificial sophonts, offered a new source of hope for the IISS.
Unfortunately, the onset of the Collapse made the argument a moot point.

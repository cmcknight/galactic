
On Cafad (3135) a low-tech human population was discovered. The Vilani
efforts to integrate the Cafadi humans into their Grand Imperium progressed
slowly. The world relapsed into barbarism at the onset of the Long Night.
After centuries of contact with the Third Imperium, Cafad had started to
re-embrace technology. With the onset of Virus and the Collapse, the Cafadi
leaders are now convinced that the Old Ways should be reembraced and
technology is once again shunned. The Cafadi are extremely xenophobic and
look upon any item of high technology as extremely taboo. The Corridor
sector was first entered at the world Sharkagu (3235) by ships of the
Sharurshid merchant company out of Sakin (Vland: 0135). Sharkagu, only 1
jump away, strongly resembled Sakin and the colony there had maintained
close relations with the mother planet throughout its history; indeed, it
never requested independence throughout the Long Night, and remained a
Sakin colony until the Collapse rendered interstellar travel obsolete in
the region.

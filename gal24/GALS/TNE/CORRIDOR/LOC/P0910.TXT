
The population of Drayne (0910) has successfully maintained a starfaring
culture thanks to the pre-Collapse presence of a Vargr military base and
the use of pillaged research prototypes from the former Imperial Research
Station located there. Virus has been rebuffed on repeated attempts to
crush this system's will, the hybrid Human-Vargr culture just keeps finding
ways to defeat invading Vampire Fleets. Intelligence reports indicate that
some electronic means of fighting Virus may have been discovered at the
research facility.

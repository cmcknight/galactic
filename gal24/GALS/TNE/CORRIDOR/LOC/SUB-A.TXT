Subsector Notes

This subsector fared relatively well when the initial onslaught of Virus
hit the subsector in 1133. Several advance reports of the attacks in the
rimward Imperium had given the inhabitants of Khouth enough time to pack
their belongings and "get out of Dodge." Unfortunately, there simply
weren't enough ships in the region to safely deliver everyone to the safes
of the Domain of Deneb. Those who remained have been subjected to decades
of death, destruction and subjugation at the hands of Virus. Ninety-four
percent of the subsector's surviving population are the Vargr of Serk,
whose advanced civil defense mechanism enabled more people to survive. Serk
serves as a clandestine forward base of the Pack in the New Era. Vargr
skirting the Regency quarantine laws send recon teams to Serk to evaluate
future potential resettlement of the wilds and exploitation of the riches
therein.

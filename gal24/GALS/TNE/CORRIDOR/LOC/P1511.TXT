blows in orbit of Depot (1511) in 1119. Following joint exercises against
Vargr fleets in the region, ships from either side exchanged shots during
salvage operations. Which side delivered the first salvoes was not clear,
but further cooperation against the Vargr ended abruptly afterwards, a fact
that history shows hurt the Vilani-settled worlds there. At the onset of
the Collapse and destruction of Depot's shipbuilding facilities, the system
has been renamed for its primary star, Zinadura.

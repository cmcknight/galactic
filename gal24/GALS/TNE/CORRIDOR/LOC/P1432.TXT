
Tarin Sink (1432) was an Imperial client state and site of Corridor
Research Station Epsilon. Nine extended families colonized the planet in
the 300s during the wave of spinward expansion. The pre-Collapse
inhabitants were their descendants. The Imperium later established a
separate facility manned by its own personnel. It grew until it was
officially designated Research Station Epsilon. Epsilon served as a
clearinghouse for unexplained phenomena. Within it were records of bizarre
happenings and mysterious relics dating back tens or hundreds of millennia.
Untranslated non-human accounts and strange engines predating the First
Imperium await the person able to read or operate them. Many items in the
station's collection are so odd that they are freely displayed to the
public, although Tarin Sink's position within the Great Rift limited the
number of visitors even before the Collapse.

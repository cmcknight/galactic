
The taint of radioactive gases in the atmosphere of Ishirdu (0338) led to
the evolution of the psionically gifted Idu, who live in widely scattered
woodland homes and supply their needs by telekinetic manipulations. The
population of four thousand is optimum to them, and they maintain it
carefully. Their psionic skills shocked the Scouts of the Rydel
expeditions, and the Navy interdicted the world, despite the non-aggressive
character of the Irdu. The Irdu have been entirely left alone by Virus, due
to their remote location. No expeditions have been made to the planet since
before the Collapse.

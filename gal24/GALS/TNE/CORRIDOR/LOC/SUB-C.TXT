Subsector Notes

This backwater subsector benefitted from having several low-tech worlds.
Because Virus could not find an adequate conduit through which to wreak
destruction on many of these worlds, they did not suffer the fates of their
higher tech brethren. Subsequent orbital bombardment and kamikaze crashes
into urban centers by Doomslayer Virus strains, however, did their part in
reducing population levels. Lemish Subsector remains perhaps irretrievably
locked in its dismal state as a little visited or wanted region of
interstellar space.

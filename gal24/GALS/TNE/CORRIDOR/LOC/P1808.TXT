
The starport and industrial capacity of Lemish (1808) were severely damaged
by Vargr raids during the Rebellion. The planetary governor fervently
declared his unwillingness to pay protection money to Vargr corsairs. In
retaliation, the Vargr mustered a fleet and sacked the planet, specifically
concentrating their attacks on the port and manufacturing complexes. The
shipyards were totally destroyed, and the other port facilities were barely
functional after the attack. Rebuilding efforts never could effectively get
under way with the chaos of the war making it difficult to get much-needed
supplies. The onset of the Collapse and subsequent waves of Vampire attacks
diminished the population even further and set the Lemishans back even
further. The current population survives in the ruins of the old cities and
maintains the remnant technology as best they can.

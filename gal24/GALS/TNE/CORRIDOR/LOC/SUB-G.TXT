Subsector Notes

This backwater subsector has suffered more from lack of interstellar
contact than anything else. Little visited by Virus, the populations of
Naadi's systems live out their lives in hope of one day reestablishing
contact with the people their elders and ancestors knew in the neighboring
regions of civilized space. Many believe, however, that no such place
exists anymore.

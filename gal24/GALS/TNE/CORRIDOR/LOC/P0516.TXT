
When first colonized from Ian in the late 100s, Raiga (0516) had a thin,
tainted atmosphere. Volcanoes were broken open to raise the atmosphere
density and bacteria were sown to remove the taint from the air. An
unforeseen burst of radiation from Raiga's primary caused some of the
bacteria to mutate into a deadly strain. While the original taint had been
largely removed, the mutated bacteria proved fatal to most human
inhabitants. A few developed an immunity. While these "immunes" have grown
to a sizeable population, the planet was quarantined to non-natives. The
natives cannot leave, either, since they are carriers of the deadly
bacteria Lucellia Raigae.

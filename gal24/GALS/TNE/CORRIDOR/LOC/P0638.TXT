
The inhabitants of Esi-obe (0638) have maintained a small fleet of Rift-
jumper Seeker starships, capable of two consecutive 4-parsec jumps. After an
initial attempt to make contact with spinward states failed to return (the
expedition was destroyed by RQS starships), Esi-obe has not attempted to
reestablish contact with other systems. Their remaining four Riftjumpers
are kept in the best condition possible, however, for an eventual attempt
to recontact some of the trailing states with whom the Esi-obeans
traditionally did business.

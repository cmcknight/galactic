
Plunge (2505) stands at the head of the great Ushamla Main that once spread
commerce coreward of the Great Rift. The planet's population lived in
tunnels hollowed into the planet's crust, made inhospitable by the
Collapse. Trade brought great wealth to Plunge, and the biggest businessmen
were the leaders of the government. Their powers were dictatorial, but they
were said to have exhibited great respect for their underlings. The
descendants of the ruling class and the Plebeian class are the sole
inhabitants of Plunge in the New Era.


The people of Igudi (2836) abandoned most technology during the Long Night.
Its climate is quite hospitable to humans, and the inhabitants grew to
prefer an essentially pastoral existence. Certain native animals have been
domesticated for food and wool. The populace had shown very little
inclination to technological advancement since its recontact by the Third
Imperium in the first century. Interstellar merchants occasionally visited
the world to trade with the locals until the Collapse occurred. Those few
comforts of interstellar trade enjoyed by the natives were then lost, and
the minimal starport facilities abandoned. In the early days of the
Collapse, several Doomslayer-strain Virus ships either intentionally
crash-landed on the planet, or unloaded their ordinance into several
habitations, lowering the population considerably. In the intervening
decades, the Igudans have recovered most of the lost population. Vampire
Fleets have, on occasion, raided Igudi for human slave labor, but for the
most part, the system is left alone.


The population of Ighoth (1904) numbered in the tens of thousands until
1117. In that year a mysterious sublight vessel entered the system at high
speed, apparently on automatic pilot. Vargr system defense boats boarded
the giant derelict, found no cause for alarm, and brought it back to
Ighoth. Within a week, contact with Ighoth ceased. Ships jumping into the
system encountered orbiting quarantine buoys prohibiting landing. Radio
communications went unanswered. EMS scans of the world's surface revealed
little or no activity. The logical assumption was that the derelict had
carried some sort of virus which evaded local decontamination procedures
and wiped out the planet's inhabitants. Shortly thereafter, Imperial
authorities declared the Ighoth system off limits for fear of spreading
whatever virulent epidemic wiped out the local Vargr.


The star Lasher (1430) holds a subsector all to itself. The Navy discovered
extensive deposits of lanthanum on an inner planet of the system during the
Grand Survey. The planet's insidious atmosphere makes the mines difficult
to work, forcing cumbersome protective gear and short work sessions. The
entire population of 600 lived in an orbital rotating torus constructed by
the Navy. The population could not be evacuated before the onslaught of
Virus forced the Domain of Deneb to close its borders and is presumed to
have died.

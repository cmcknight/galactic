
On Gagh Veth (1603) during the Rebellion era the Vargr population of this
planet were evenly divided among three high-charisma leaders: Saegh Urr
Fagnu, Vaefors Zeghz, and Gzonging Gzeth. The resulting civil war reduced
local technology to the bronze age, tech level 1. Though the Vargrs'
self-wrought destruction of this planet made it an unlikely target for
Virus, they have nevertheless been unable to recover from the devastating
wars they fought amongst one another.


Gzorraeth (0701) was owned by Ulroudzoe Mining, a major corporation based
within the Dzarrgh Federate during the pre-Collapse era. Ulroudzoe
established Gzorraeth as its first extra-Federate mining operation. The
world had become Ulroudzoe's chief supplier of radioactives. Imperial
authorities suspected Ulroudzoe of manufacturing fission warheads on
Gzorraeth and selling them to corsairs. During the late stages of the
Rebellion, a pre-emptive strike was enacted upon this facility by a
squadron of close escorts hailing from the Denebi 61st Fleet. So effective
was the strike that Vargr corsair activity was literally halved following
the assault. Gzorraeth's economy and infrastructure were so devastated that
the government collapsed and the world fell into turmoil. It turned out to
be a blessing in disguise. When Virus-infected ships attacked the system,
the defunct (not to mention decidedly low-tech) computer system could not
be infected. Nevertheless, aerial bombardment of the planet by Vampire
ships did result in the deaths of several thousand Vargr.

Subsector Notes

Besides the Massacre of Irasumshu, the populations of Ian Subsector systems
have not been too badly damaged. Advanced warning of the coming Vampire
Fleets enabled the peoples of this region to make preparations, including
the shutdown of all non-essential computer and electronic equipment. Not
including Irasumshu, the subsector has only suffered a 16 percent decline
in population since the Rebellion. The complete suppression of interstellar
trade and excommunication from civilized space has, however, devastated the
economies and progression of Ian Subsector.

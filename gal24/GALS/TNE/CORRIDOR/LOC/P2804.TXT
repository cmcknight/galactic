
On Neghu Oug (2804) the population up until the time of the Collapse was an
uneven mixture of Vargr and Ojehshodu, the world's indigenous minor race.
The Ojehshodu are a race of large, aquatic mammals, unsuited for life on
dry land -- very little of which exists on ocean-swathed Neghu Oug. The
technologically unsophisticated Ojehshodu readily submitted to foreign rule
when the Vargr arrived; even today, their contributions to the planet's
administration are practically invisible. Interestingly, one Vargr
sociologist, Dartsongze, suggested in 972 that the Ojehshodu ran the
planetary government, manipulating the Vargr leaders as unsuspecting
puppets. Dartsongze was murdered within weeks. It is uncertain to this day
whether he had uncovered an Ojehshodu plot or was killed at the request of
insulted Vargr politicians. The Ojehshodu saw no small amount of poetic
justice when the Vargr were arbitrarily annihilated by invading Vampire
Fleets after the Collapse. The Ojehshodu now live peaceably in their
oceanic homes.

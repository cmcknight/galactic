r10 Combat Rifle, r11 Combat Rifle & r15 Combat Rifle

During the Second Mwoah War the deficencies of the r9 combat rifle rapidly
became apparent. In an attempt to overcome these the r10 combat rifle was
hastily designed and put into production (along with a reintroduction of the
r3). Whilst the r10 was a definite improvement over the r9, it still proved
to be unreliable under service conditions. However the design held promise
and continued development work resulted in the r11 combat rifle. The r11 was
introduced during the later stages of the Second Mwoah War and proved to be a
very successful design; combining the accuracy, reliablity and hitting power
of the older r3 with the lighter weight caseless ammunition of the r10. The
r11 has been widely produced and is the defacto standard weapon with higher
tech Diadochi forces. A slightly improved TL 11 version (the r15) remains the
standard Magellanic combat rifle to this day. The r11 has been widely
exported and is also produced under licence by several independent Diadochi
states. Butlaar Small Arms also produce a semiautomatic only version (the BSA
M2301) for the civilian market; there are currently no civilian versions of
either the r10 or r15, though considerable quantities of the r10 have been
disposed of on the surplus market.

The r11 is a bullpup combat rifle firing a 7mm caseless discarding sabot
ammunition with a 4.5mm tungsten penetrator from a 100 round detachable
magazine. It is capable of either semiautomatic, 5 round burst or full cyclic
(500 rpm) fire. The r11 is fully gyrostabilised and fitted with an intergral
laser sight with power provided by two 5 hour rechargable battery packs (the
r10 uses only one 5 hour battery pack; and the r15 uses a single 10 hour
battery pack).

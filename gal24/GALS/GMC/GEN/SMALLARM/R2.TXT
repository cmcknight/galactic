r2 Laser Rifle

The r2 laser rifle was first designed in 1689T for the IMSC as the M1689
laser rifle, as their standard issue weapon for vacuum use. During the early
stages of the First Mwoah War, it was found that since the Mwoah had never
developed lasers for ground combat, the r2 could be employed as a highly
effective standard infantry weapon. All reports indicate that the silent,
undetectable nature of the r2 had a considerable morale effect on the Mwoah.
However later in the war, the Mwoah developed ablative body armours; and the
r2 was relegated to it's original role. None the less, the r2 remained the
standard issue zero-g weapon until replaced by the r13 laser rifle in 2312T;
and is still a very popular weapon with civilains and Diadochi forces alike.

The r2 is a conventionally stocked laser rifle firing a 1230j 5mm pulsed beam
in single pulse mode. The r2 contains an internal superconductor magazine
containng 50 shots. It can recharged from either a battery backpack (capable
of recharging 1 shot per second) or any standard high energy power coupling.
The r2 is fitted with an intergral laser sight with a 5 hour rechargeable
battery (an apparently redundancy in the design). Some variants of the r2
allow for an emergency recharge of the weapons magazine from the sight
battery (the battery can recharge up to four shots, taking 24 seconds per
shot).

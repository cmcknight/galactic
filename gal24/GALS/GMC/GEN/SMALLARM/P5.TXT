p5 Body Pistol

The p5 body pistol was developed to provide a concealable personal defence
weapon for covert operatives. Manufactured entirely from advanced polymers
and ceramics, the resulting weapon is virtually indetectable to TL 12 and
below portal sensors. The p5 itself consists solely of the internal workings
of the weapon and it can be concealed in an almost limitless variety of
seemingly innocuous objects (cameras, purses, spectical cases etc.; anything
large enough to hold the mechanical workings). It is widely rumoured that
various intelligence agenices utilise even more advanced body pistols; but
this is officially denied by the agencies concerned.

The p5 is a semiautomatic pistol firing 5mm caseless rounds from a 6 round
internal magazine. Due to the concealed nature of the p5, reloading the
magazine is a difficult task and takes at least 18 seconds if it is possible
at all. The p5 is widely used by both Imperial and Diadochi intelligence and
law enforcement agencies, as well as being very popular amongst the criminal
elements of Magellanic society. It is not however available for civilian
purchase, but the Phoenix Corporation produce a similar model (the Agent P50)
which is manufactured from standard alloys and utilises a conventional pistol
shape. Naturally this weapon is detectable by most common methods and the
specialist ceramic ammunition is not available on the civilain market.

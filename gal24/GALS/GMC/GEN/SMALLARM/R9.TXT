r9 Combat Rifle

The r9 combat rifle was introduced to Magellanic service shortly after the
First Mwoah War as a replacement for the r3. Unfortunately it proved to be a
disappointing weapon, deficent in range and hitting power, as well as being
prone to malfunction under field conditions. However the r9 was manufactured
in considerable quantities and many of these weapons have since been disposed
of to other states. The Karadzic Empire purchased considerable numbers of
this weapon and later aquired the surplus production tooling and under the
guise of the Vz 204, have adopted it as their standard infantry weapon. No
manufacturer currently produces a version of the r9 for the civilian market,
though the Phoenix Corporation did at one time produce a semiautomatic only
variant (the Phoenix 5900); however production of this weapon was terminated
in 2295T.

The r9 is a bullpup combat rifle firing 5mm caseless ammunition from a 250
round detachable magazine. The r9 is capable of either semiautomatic, 5 round
burst or full cyclic fire (1250rpm). The extremly high rate of fire, coupled
with its generous magazine capacity enables it to make a +2DM autofire attack
per 125 rounds fired. The weapon is fitted with an intergral laser sight, a
basic bipod for use as a squad automatic weapon and is fully gyrostablised.

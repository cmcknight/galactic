c4 Machine Carbine

The c4 machine carbine is the standard issue Magellanic sidearm for front
line non-combatant personnel. It fires a conventional 8.5mm caseless round
(as used by the p6 pistol) from a 75 round detachable magazine. It is capable
of firing in semiautomatic, 5 round burst, or full cyclic (750rpm, giving a
+1DM attack per 75 rounds fired) modes. The c4 is fully gyrostabilised and
fitted with an intergral laser sight (accepting the same battery packs as the
r3 and r11). Whilst the c4 is capable of being fired as a handgun with the
stock collapsed, it is intened to primarily be fired as a longarm. The c4 is
also produced as the semiautomatic only Phoenix 4000 carbine for the civilian
market.

Armstrong MkVI Revolver

The Armstrong MkVI revolver is a popular shipboard security weapon. It fires
either a 9mm full charge caseless ball or reduced charge cassless HEAP round
from a 6 round cylinder. The MkVI is a standard top break single and double
action revolver, featuring a decocking lever allowing the weapon to be
carried safely with the hammer resting on a loaded chamber. When using the
HEAP round the weapon can be regarded as a low recoil weapon for zero-g
combat. Unlike many revolvers the MkVI does not feature a removable cylinder
for quick reloading and therefore the cylinders must be reloaded whilst still
in the weapon. To assist in loading, a 'speedloader' has been developed. This
is a simple mechanical device holding 6 rounds, which can then be inserted
into the cylinder in one action. The speedloaders themselves have no
effective mass, but they are somewhat bulky when loaded with ammunition.

r14 Gauss Combat Rifle

The r14 gauss rifle was intended as a replacement for the r11 combat rifle.
It entered service trials in 2356T. However it rapidly became apparent that
the r14 was not suitable for general deployment. The major problems with it
were it's excessive reload weight, high cost and limited availability of
production facilities. These factors lead to the abandonment of the r11
replacement program and the development of the r15 combat rifle (an improved
r11). However the r14 did enter limited production for certain specialist
roles, it is believed that production has since been terminated and that less
than 100,000 examples were manufactured.

The r14 is a bullpup gauss combat rifle firing 3mm ferrotungsten needles from
a 100 round detachable magazine (the 3mm needle is the same as used in the
r16 gauss sniper rifle). The r14 is fully gyrostabilised and fitted with an
internal laser sight. The r14 can fire in either single shot, 5 round burst,
or full cyclic (1500rpm theoretical, usually derated to 1000rpm; allowing a
+1DM autofire attack per 100 rounds) modes. The magazine contains 100 x 1850j
superconductor banks which can be recharged from any standard high energy
conection. The r14 is not currently available for civilian purchase.

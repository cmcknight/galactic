Si72 Survival Rifle

Whilst the Si72 Survival Rifle is an item of standard issue Imperial
Magellanic equipment, it is not officially a weapon but rather an item of
survial equipment (hence it's designation). The Si72 was first introduced to
the IMSC in 1842T as the M1842 Survival Rifle to replace the venerable M1335
(now known as the Phoenix SR6). The Si72 is also frequently encountered in
the regulation survival kits carried by commrcial starships.

The Si72 is a conventially stocked breakaction single shot shotgun firing a
12.5mm cased round. The round can either be a single solid slug, 21 x 5.5mm
pellets or 16 x 2.5mm hardened steel flechettes. The rifle itself can be
disassembled into 3 parts (barrel, action and stock) all of which can then be
stored in the stock. The stock itself is constructed of high impact plastic
and is fully watertight. Due to it's lightweight hollow contruction, the Si72
will actually float. Most Si72's found in standard survival kits come with
25 rounds of ammunition (15 pellet, 5 slug and 5 flechette) in a lightweight
disposable waterproof case.

Pellet and flechette rounds inflict 5D and 4D worth of damage (dropping by 1D
per range band over effective range) if they penetrate. Also their damage
against flexible armours is based on their damage not their penetration (e.g.
if a flechette round strikes 1 point flexible armour it will inflict 3D plus
1 damage; if a pellet round strikes 3 point flexible armour it will inflict
5 points of damage).

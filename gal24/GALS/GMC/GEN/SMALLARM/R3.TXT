r3 Combat Rifle, r7 Sniper Rifle & r8 Combat Rifle

The r3 or M1707 rifle is the oldest small arm design still in current service
with the Magellanic Empire. The rifle was was adopted as the standard IMSC
longarm in 1707T and despite the recent introduction of the r17 rifle to
replace it with the Patrol Service and Security Branch, there are no plans to
replace it in general IMSC service. The r3 has a well deserved reputation for
reliablity, accuracy and hitting power. The r3 was the 'standard' Magellanic
small arm during the First Mwoah War and well over 60 million examples were
produced during that conflict. Figures for total production are unknown, but
they would run into the hundreds of millions. The r3 is also very popular
with civilians and remains the de facto standard for lower tech Diadochi
forces. The r3, r3b and r7 have been adopted by the Civtra Confederation; who
produce them as the M1 rifle, M2 light machine gun and M3 sniper rifle.

The r3 is a fully stocked TL 10 combat rifle firing cased 7mm (either ball or
discarding sabot) ammunition. The r3 can fire in either semiautomatic, 3
round burst or full cyclic (600rpm) modes. The r3 is fully gyrostabilised and
fitted with an intergral laser sight. It uses detachable 30 or 50 round
magazines and can be fitted with all standard Magellanic enhanced sighting
devices and under barrel attachments. The r3 is capable of firing ammunition
manufactured from TL 6 to TL 10 with no appreciable loss of performance (note
the discarding sabot rounds can only be manufactured at TL 10) and spent
cartridges are readily reloadable. Five common variants exist: the r3a, which
is simply a standard r3 fitted with a collapasble stock; the r3b, a support
version fitted with a bipod and fixed mounting points, and capable of using a
200 round feedbox in addition to standard magazines; the r7 sniper rifle
(detailed below); the r8, a version without the advanced electronics designed
to be produced at tech level 6 (detailed below); and the Phoenix 707, a
semiautomatic only civilian version (this version is actually produced by
many different manufacturers under differing names, but the Phoenix 707 is
representative).

The r7 sniper rifle was developed from the r3 in during the First Mwoah War.
The r7 is a long barrelled accuratised r3 fitted with a bipod and an EIS-10
sight (featuring a +1 HUD, thermal imaging and light amplification). The r7
was replaced in Magellanic service by the r12 shortly before the Second Mwoah
War, but it remains in use with many lower tech Diadochi states and has
proved to be a popular civilian hunting rifle and is still produced by
several manufacturers (of which the Phoenix 7000 is representative). Civilian
versions are capable of semiautomatic fire only. The r7 is issued with a
small lightweight 10 round magazine, but retains the capacity to use the
standard 30 and 50 round magazines.

Like the r7, the r8 was developed during the First Mwoah War. It is basically
a low tech version of the basic r3. It is however designed to be capable of
firing all standard r3 rounds (including the tech level 10 discarding sabot
round). The r8 lacks the advanced electronics and gyrostabilisation of the
standard r3 and is considerably heavier, however it is also considerably
cheaper. Konig Arms MCC produce a semiautomatic only varient of the r8 (the
Konig KLR-23) for the civilian market.

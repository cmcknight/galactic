p2 Revolver, c2 Machine Carbine, r5 Rifle & r6 Shotgun

With the outbreak of the First Mwoah War the Magellanic Empire had an
immediate need for cheap, low tech small arms suitable for issue to their
ally states beyond the Diska Rift. In response to this several weapons (the
p2 revolver, c2 machine carbine, r5 rifle and r6 shotgun) were adopted 'off
the shelf' to fill this need. These weapons were never issued to Magellanic
forces as such, but was used to equip allied forces recuited from worlds
insufficently developed to handle more advanced equipment. These weapons were
produced in considerable quantities both within the Empire and by various
allied states. None of these weapons are standard issue, but the Empire still
retains stocks for issue to low tech allies. The weapons have also proved to
be popular with low tech enthusists, who take great pride in the skill
required for accurate shooting without advanced sighting aids.

The p2 revolver
The p2 was adapted from the civilian Konig KHP-4 revolver. This design is a
remarkably cost effective weapon given it's low tech design. The r2 is a
standard swing out heavy frame revolver, capable of being used as either a
double or single action weapon. It features an ambidexterous decocking lever,
allowing the weapon to be carried safely with the hammer resting on a loaded
chamber. The p2 fires rimmed 11mm cased ammunition from a 6 chamber cylinder;
which can be removed and replaced with a preloaded one to allow for faster
reloading. The p2 remains a very popular weapon with civilians and law
enforcement agencies, as well as many low tech armed forces.

The c2 machine carbine
The c2 was intended to give low tech forces a degree of automatic fire
capacity. As such the c2 differs from normal Magellanic carbine practice in
that rather than firing a pistol cartridge, it fires a low powered rifle
round. Originally known as the EIEIO L-3, the c2 has proven to be a reliable
and versatile weapon. The c2 is a conventionally stocked carbine, which fires
a 6.35mm cased round from a detachable 40 round magazine; and is capable of
either smiautomatic or full cyclic (400rpm) fire. Estelar Irand Engineering
Industries Organisation (EIEIO) also produce a semiautomatic only variant
(the EIEIO Swift 25) for the civilian market.

The r5 rifle
This weapon was initially known as the Awerl M87 rifle. It's basic design is
exceedingly simply, lending itself well to low cost volume production. The r5
is a conventionally stocked bolt action rifle, firing 7.5mm cased ammunition
from a 5 round internal magazine. The rifle is reloaded by the use of a
disposable 5 round charger clip (open the bolt, line up the charger, press
home the rounds and discard the charger). A process taking a trained user
less than three seconds. Loose rounds can be added to the magazine at any
time. To fully load the magazine using loose rounds takes a trained user
approximately ten seconds. The r5 can accept a basic telescopic sight and is
suitable for firing most standard rifle grenades.

The r6 shotgun
The r6 was another civilian weapon (the Terack 175) with minimal adaptations
for military service. The r6 is a simple but effective conventionally stocked
TL 4 pump action shotgun firing a 17.5mm cased round from an internal 8 shot
tube magazine mounted under the weapon, parallel with the barrel. The rounds
can contain either a single solid slug, 19 x 8mm pellets, or 16 x 3.5mm
armour piercing hardened steel flechettes. The magazines can be reloaded with
loose rounds at any time (a process taking a trained user approximately 15
seconds). The r6 is a smoothbore weapon and as such is incapable of aimed
fire beyond long range.

Weapon: r6 shotgun
Action: Pump - singleshot
Ignition: Percussion
Tech Level: 4
Calibre: 17.5mm Terrack cased
Penetration: slug: 3, pellet: 1, flechette: 2 (see notes below)
Range: very short, flechette: short
Malfunction: reliable
Shots: 8
Mass: 2.6kg
Reloads: 0.7kg
Length: 68.7cm
Cost: Cr 80
Incidentals: 8 rounds slug: Cr 0.8 (0.7kg)
             8 rounds pellet: Cr 1.6 (0.7kg)
             8 rounds flechette: Cr 3.2 (0.7kg)

Pellet and flechette rounds inflict 4D worth of damage (dropping by 1D per
range band over effective range) if they penetrate. Also their damage against
flexible armours is based on their damage not their penetration (e.g. if a
flechette round strikes 1 point flexible armour, it inflicts 3D plus 1 point
of damage; if a pellet round strikes 2 point flexible armour, it will inflict
4 points of damage).

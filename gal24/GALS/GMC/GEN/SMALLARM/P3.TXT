p3 Laser Pistol

During the First Mwoah War it was found that the Mwoah had never developed
lasers for the antipersonnel role or adequate defences against them; and
therefore the r2 laser rifle proved to be very effective in the early stages
of the war. As a result, the IMSC developed the p3 laser pistol as a
companion for the r2. However later in the war, the Mwoah developed defensive
armour against lasers and the effectiveness of the p3 became marginal. After
the war the p3 was dropped from service. However when the Magellanic Navy was
formed in 2214T, that service adopted the p3 as it's standard dress sidearm.
The Navy officially replaced the p3 with the p7 in 2359T; however most senior
naval officers and many NCOs still prefer to carry the p3 (Magellanic custom
allows officers of grade O4 and over and enlisted personnel of grade E7 and
over to carry their choice of sidearm).

The p3 fires 443j 5mm pulsed beam in either single pulse or 3 pulse burst
mode. the p3 contains in internal superconductor magazine with a capacity of
24 shots, this magazine can be recharged from a belt mounted rechargeable
battery pack or any standard high energy power source.

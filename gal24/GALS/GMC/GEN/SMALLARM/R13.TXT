r13 Laser Rifle

The r13 laser rifle was introduced into Magellanic service in 2312T, as a
replacement for the venerable r2. The r13 features a variable discharge
magazine. Each full power 'shot' actually consists of ten seperate banks of
superconductors. The firer can also select to discharge one (penertration 3),
two (penetration 4), or five (penetration 5) banks for each shot. The r13's
internal magazine contains 200 individual banks (20 full power shots). The
r13 is also capable of being used as a laser sight/designator and contains an
intergral 10 hour rechargeable battery for this function (this battery can
not be used to recharge the magazine). The r13 has been superceaded by the
c5 snub machine carbine as the standard zero-g weapon in Magellanic service
but remains a popular weapon with forward observers. The r13 is not currently
available for sale to civilians.

The r13 is capable of firing either in either single pulse or 4 pulse burst
mode. At full power the r13 fires a 5mm 7000j pulsed beam, which is downrated
in proportion to the number of banks discharged in the shot. In sighting mode
the r13 functions as a 0.01j continuous beam laser. Firing the weapon does
not disrupt the designator/sight as long as the target is not shifted. The
r13 can be conected to a variety of standard battery backpacks, all capable
of recharging up to 1% of their capacity per second. The r13 can also be
recharged from any standard high energy power connection.

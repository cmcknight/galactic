r1 Combat Rifle

The r1 combat rifle is a very old weapon design. It began life in 1235T as
the GIR(m)-52 as the standard infantry rifle for the Terran Magellanic
District. The rifle survived the collapse of the Terran Empire as the
standard issue rifle with the remnant Terran forces on Breakout. In 1341T it
was adopted by the IMSC as the M1341 and remained standard issue until
replaced by the M1707 (later to become the r3). However it remained standard
issue with Breakout until it was finally replaced by the M1707 in 2182T. The
weapon recieved a new lease of life with the outbreak of the First Mwoah War
in 2197T. The Viceroy found herself with a desperate shortage of smallarms
and considerable stocks of the GIR(m)-52 on hand and it's production tooling
still in place. In 2199T the Magellanic Empire rationalised it's small arms
designation system and as the oldest design the GIR(m)-52 was designated the
r1. The r1 remained in production throughout the First Mwoah War, issued to
many allied forces recruited from beyond the Diska Rift. With the end of the
war, the r1 was again dropped from Magellanic service, but it remains popular
to this day with civilains and lower tech forces.

The r1 is a conventionally stocked rifle firing 5.5mm cased ammunition from
a 60 round detachable magazine. It is capable of firing either semiautomatic,
5 round burst or full cyclic (600rpm). The r1 can accept most standard
enchanced sighting devices and under barrel fittings. A semiautomatic only
version (the GIR-52) is produced by a variety of manufacturers for the
civilian market.

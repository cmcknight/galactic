Design Notes
------------
These weapons were all designed using Greg Porter's revised 3rd edition
"Guns, Guns, Guns" (usually abbreviated G3G) supplement published by the
Blackburg Tactical Research Centre (copyright 1996). Their statistics and
performance have been converted to 4th Edition Traveller values using the
guidelines in that supplement.

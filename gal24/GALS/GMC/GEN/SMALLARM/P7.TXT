p7 Snub Pistol

The p7 pistol is the current issue Magellanic handgun. Accepted for service
in 2342T, it is the first so called snub weapon to be standard issue with the
Magellanic forces. The distinguishing feature of the p7 is its low velocity
11.7mm caseless HEAP ammunition. This enables the weapon to have a good
penetration without requiring normal high velocity rounds, however the
resulting weapon and ammunition are very expensive and the earlier
conventional p6 still remains in service for second line personnel. The p7 is
capable of semiautomatic and 4 round burst fire; and is fitted with an
intergral laser sight. The light HEAP projectile loses velocity extremely
rapidly and the p7 is incapable of aimed fire beyond medium range, however
the p7 does count as a low recoil weapon for zero-g environments. The p7 is
not currently available on the civilian market.

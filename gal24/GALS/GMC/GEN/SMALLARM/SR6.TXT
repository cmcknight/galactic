Phoenix SR6 Survival Rifle

The Phoenix SR6 survival rifle started life as the M1335 rifle, first issued
to IMSC personnel involved in the Phoenix Project in 1335T. The M1335 was the
only standard issue weapon with the IMSC until the introduction of the M1341
combat rifle in 1341T; and even after that time, it remained in limited
issue as part of the standard IMSC M1338 survival kit. The simplicity and
ruggedness of the M1335 were to have a major influence over the design of the
legendary M1707 combat rifle (now known as the r3). The use of cased
ammunition for the M1707 was a direct result of experience with the M1335.
Ultimately the M1335 was replaced by the M1842 survival rifle (now called
the Si72 survival rifle) in IMSC service, but it still remains widely
available; both as an independent weapon and as part of the standard Survial
Kits required by Imperial regulations.

The SR6 is a very simple pump action rifle. It fires a 6mm cased ball round
from an internal box magazine with a 5 round capacity. The SR6 is fitted with
a simple collapsing stock for ease of storage. Whilst it may be fired with
the stock collapsed, this is not recommended.

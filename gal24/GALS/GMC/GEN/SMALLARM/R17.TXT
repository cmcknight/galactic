r17 Combat Rifle

The r17 combat rifle is the latest small arm to enter Magellanic service.
Adopted by the IMSC in 2368T as a limited replacement for the venerable r3
with the Patrol service and Security branch. The r17 is a revolutionary
weapon which incorporates several radical new features. The most obvious new
feature is the use of a metered binary propellant rather than the usual self
contained round. The r17 has two power levels (full or 100% and low or 25%).
At the high setting the r17 functions as a normal ACR, whereas at the low
setting the r17 is a low recoil weapon suitable for zero-g environments. A
fully charged propellant cartridge contains sufficent propellant for either
65 full power shots or 260 low power shots (or any combination). The second
new feature of the r17 is the fully intergrated HETL sight, incorporating a
+3 HUD, an EMF sight, a thermal conversion sight and a laser designator. This
allows for the r17 to be fired without exposing anything other than the
weapon. Finally the r17 is optimised to fire a wide variety of ammunition
(5.6mm discarding sabot, ball and HEAP) to enable it to deal with a wide
variety of differing circumstances.

The r17 also features all the characteristics that might be expected of a
normal military combat rifle; it has a modern bullpup design, is fully
gyrostablised, and capable of firing either semiautomatic, 5 round burst, or
full cyclic (650rpm for a +1 DM attack per 65 rounds). Butlaar Small Arms
also manufacture a semiautomatic only version (the BSA M2368) lacking the
advanaced sights (it retains only the intergral laser designator) for the
civilian market. Currently the advanced discarding sabot and HEAP rounds are
not available on the civilian market.

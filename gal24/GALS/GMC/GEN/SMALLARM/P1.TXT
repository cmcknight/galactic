p1 Pistol, p4 Pistol, c1 Machine Carbine & c3 Machine Carbine

Whilst the p1 pistol and c1 machine carbine are no longer standard issue
weapons in any Magellanic service, they remain very popular with lower tech
Diadochi and civilians. Both weapons fire the same 7.5mm cased ammunition and
their 15 and 30 round magazines are interchangeable (however the 75 round
magazine can only be used with the c1, which must then be used two handed).
Both weapons were designed for the IMSC at the same time as the r3 rifle (and
are also TL 10 designs) and share many features with that weapon. As with the
r3, they both can fire ammunition manufactured between TL 6 and TL 10 with no
appreciable loss of performance and their ammunition can be readily reloaded.
The p1 can only fire in semiautomatic mode, but the c1 can also fire in
semiautomatic, 3 round burst and full cyclic (750rpm, giving a +1DM attack
per 75 rounds). Whilst the c1 is designed to be fired as a longarm, it can be
fired one handed with the stock collapsed. The c1 is fully gyrostabilised and
features an intergral laser sight. Both are still produced within the Empire
by a number of manufacturers for the civilian and Diadochi market; and the
Phoenix P10 and C75 (a semiautomatic only version of the c1) are
representative of these. They are also standard issue with the Civtra
Confederation who produce them as the M4 pistol and M5 submachine gun.

During the First Mwoah War, both the p1 and c1 were redesigned to enable
their manufacture at tech level 6. The resulting redesigns were designated
the p4 and c3 respectively. The c3 lacks the gyrostabilisation of the c1, but
retains the laser sight with reduced battery life. Apart from this, and the
greater weight, the p4 and c3 are functionally identical to the p1 and c1.
The Konig KLP-3 is a semiautomatic only version of the c3 produced by Konig
Arms MCC for the civilian market. Several manufacturers produce versions of
the p4 for the civilian market under a variety of designations.

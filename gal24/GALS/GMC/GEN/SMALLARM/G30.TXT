Phoenix G30 Gauss Rifle

The Phoenix G30 is the first civilian gauss rifle to enter volume production.
First introduced by the Phoenix Corporation in 2361T, it was initially aimed
at the 'varmint rifle' market, where it's silent operation is a distinct
advantage. However the ease with which the weapon could be converted to
fully automatic fire rapidly lead to it's popularity with criminal elements.
This in turn lead to the G30 being banned on many worlds. In response to
this, the Phoenix Corporation has recently introduced the G30 Series 2, with
improved tamperproof electronics and a mechanical linkage in the action. It
should be noted that the G30 will be an unreliable weapon if converted to
fully automatic fire (assuming a rate limiter is also used, without a rate
limiter it will be very unreliable).

The G30 is a conventionally stocked semiautomatic gauss rifle, firing 3mm
ferrotungsten needles from a detachable 50 round magazine. The magazine
contains 50 superconductor banks which power the weapon. These magazines may
be recharged from any standard high energy source. The G30's needles are
interchangeable with those used in the military r14 and r16 gauss rifles. The
G30 is fitted with an intergral laser sight, powered by an internal 5 hour
rechargeable battery.

r16 Gauss Sniper Rifle

The r16 gauss sniper rifle was the first gauss weapon adopted into general
service with the Magellanic Empire. Adopted in 2361T as a replacement for the
r12, the r16 has proved to be an effective weapon in it's specialist role.
The r16 has recently been fitted with the intergral HTEL sight of the r17
combat rifle, resulting in the r16a; though this variant has yet to be issued
to service units. Even without the HTEL sight the r16 is a formidably
powerful and accurate weapon, capable of penerating even the most advanced
TL 12 body armour.

The r16 is a bullpup gauss rifle firing 3mm ferrotungsten needles in single
shot or 3 round burst mode from a 15 round detachable magazine. The r16's
magazine contain 15 x 11180j superconductor banks, which may be recharged
from any standard high energy power source. The r16 can accept all standard
Magellanic enhanced sighting devices and can be adapted for remote operation.
The r16 is fitted with a bipod and must be fired using this (or otherwise
solidly braced) to exploit it's maximum range. The r16 is fitted with an
internal laser sight and is fully gyrostabilised to ensure maximum accuracy.
The r16 is not available to civilians.

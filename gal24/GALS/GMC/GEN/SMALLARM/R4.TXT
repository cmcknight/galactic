r4 Shotgun

The r4 heavy shotgun was first designed as the CMP-93 shotgun for the Yert
Empire in 2093T. It's devastating short range firepower proved to be very
effective during the Second Yert War and had a profound influence on the
Principality of Breakout, who had neglected this class of weapon. Rather than
devlop their own weapon in this class, the Principality simply copied the
CMP-93, adopting it as the YMP shotgun. During the First Mwoah War the YMP
was designated the r4 heavy shotgun. The r4 remains the standard issue
shotgun with the Magellanic Empire, and is an immensely popular weapon
amongst Diadochi forces and civilians (though HEAP rounds are not available
to civilians).

The r4 is a conventionally stocked semiautomatic heavy shotgun firing a 20mm
round from a 10 round detachable box magazine. The rounds can either be a
single solid slug or HEAP projectile, or contain 11 x 8mm pellets or 51 x 2mm
armour peircing tungsten flechettes. The r4 is fitted with an intergral laser
sight and is fully gyrostabilised to counter the weapon's recoil. The r4 is a
smoothbore weapon and is incapable of aimed fire beyond long range. It should
also be noted that the r4's heavy recoil prevents it's classification as a
snub weapon.

Pellet and flechette rounds inflict 4D and 6D worth of damage (dropping by 1D
per range band over effective range) if they penetrate. Also their damage
against flexible armours is based on their damage not their penetration (e.g.
if a pellet round strikes 1 point flexible armour, it inflicts 3D plus 1
point of damage; if a flechette round strikes 3 point flexible armour, it
will inflict 6 points of damage). HEAP rounds have an explosive value of 2.

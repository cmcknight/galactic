p6 Pistol

The p6 pistol is the standard issue weapon for second line non-combatants. It
is a fairly typical conventional pistol, firing standard 8.5mm caseless
rounds in either semiautomatic or 4 round burst mode. It's ammunition is
compatable with that of the c4 machine carbine (though it can not accept the
c4's 75 round magazine). For the civilian market the Phoenix Corporation
manufacturers the Phoenix 6000, a semiautomatic only version of the standard
p6.

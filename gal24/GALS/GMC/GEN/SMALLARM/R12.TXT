r12 Sniper Rifle

The r12 sniper rifle was the standard issue Magellanic sniper weapon until
the introduction of the r16 gauss sniper rifle in 2361T. First issued in
2283T, the r12 was a very popular (if somewhat specialised) weapon; and is
still frequently encountered with Diadochi forces unable or unwilling to use
the more advanced r16. The r12 has recently seen a surge in popularity with
the introduction of the Phoenix 1200, a semiautomatic only version for the
civilian market.

The r12 is a bullpup sniper rifle firing a caseless 7.5mm discarding sabot
round with a 6mm tungsten alloy penetrator from a 30 round detachable
magazine. The r12 is fully gyrostabilised and fitted with an internal laser
sight. The r12 is capable of firing in either semiautomatic or 5 round burst
mode. The weapon is fitted with a bipod to assist in accurate long range
shooting and can accept all standard Magellanic enhanced sighting devices.

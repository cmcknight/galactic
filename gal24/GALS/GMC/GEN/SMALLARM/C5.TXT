c5 Snub Machine Carbine

The c5 snub machine carbine is the standard issue Magellanic zero-g weapon.
The term machine carbine is a little misleading as the weapon is closer to
an assault grenade launcher; however it is employed in the traditional
machine carbine role, hence it's designation.

The c5 is a bullpup machine carbine firing 15mm low velocity HEAP rounds from
a detachable 150 round drum magazine. The c5 is gyrostabilised and fitted
with an intergral laser sight. It may fire in either single shot, 5 round
burst or full cyclic (750rpm, giving a +1DM autofire attack per 75 rounds
fired) mode; and is treated as a low recoil weapon for zero-g combat. The c5
is not currently available to civilians.

Mwoah MCR-10 Combat Rifle

The MCR-10 is the Magellanic designation for the standard combat rifle of the
Mwoah Unity. It was first encountered during the Second Mwoah War and has
proven to be a very effective weapon. The Mwoah designation for the weapon is
the "Akalisr Zhor santi nor ri" abbreviated to "AZ 739". The MCR-10 is an
exceptionally accurate rifle and it's small calibre round gives it impressive
penetration. It's primary drawbacks are it's length and heavy recoil. The
close similarities between Human and Mwoah hands means that the MCR-10 can be
used by Humans without penalty. The MCR-10 is also produced by the Aragi
Dominion as the Rf-359a. The Rf-359a is slightly redesigned to make it more
suitable for human use, but the changes are minor.

The MCR-10 is a bullpup combat rifle, firing a cased 4.5mm ball round from a
detachable 60 round magazine. The MCR-10 is capable of firing in either
semiautomatic, 3 round burst, or full cyclic (600 rpm) modes. On full cyclic
setting the MCR-10 can make one +1DM attack per 60 rounds. The MCR-10 is
fully gyrostabilised and is fitted with a recoil absorbing stock and a Muzzle
brake to compensate for it's heavy recoil. The MCR-10 can accept a number of
advanced sighting devices, but due to the poor eyesight of the Mwoah, these
are rarely encountered. Sighting devices are somewhat more common with the
Aragi produced Rf-359a.

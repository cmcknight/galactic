The Greater Magellanic Cloud is intended to be an independent universe with
little or no conection to the traditional traveller universe of the Third
Imperium. However it would not be difficult to intergrate it into that
universe (indeed I originally created it as a part of that universe).

The Sidhe would be replaced with the tradional Ancients, the other alien
races (the Jneril, Dk'arek, Mwoah and Efrip) could either be replaced with
their canon equivilants (Aslan, Vargr, and K'Kree respectively; the Efrip
have no canon equivilant), or retained as races native to the Cloud. Or one
could "mix and match", say replacing the Jneril and Dk'arek and keeping the
Mwoah.

How could the Cloud be fitted into canon history?
-------------------------------------------------
Late in the history of the Third Imperium the wormhole was discovered along
with working gates (ancient artifacts), in around say 1080. During the
Rebellion many refugees fled throught the gate to the Cloud, there would
have been plenty around which would jump start colonisation. When the Virus
was released, it collapsed the Milky Way end of the wormhole before it could
cross into the Cloud. The rest of the history would preceed fairly much
unaltered. Some minor alterations could be made to keep some of the
traditional human cultures, but this would not be neccessary.

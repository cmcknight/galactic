Remagen District
----------------
The Remagen district contains three worlds all located deep within the Diska
Rift. The inaccessability of these worlds has left them totally undeveloped.
They were given a cursary survey during the late Terran period, but there has
been no further efforts in this district since that time. As far as can be
determined, no ship has visited any world in this district for over 400
years (though the possibility can not be totally excluded).

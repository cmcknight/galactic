St'ago District
---------------
The St'ago district forms the bulk of the Zral Finger, a ribbon of habitable
worlds extending out into the Diska Rift. The first settlement here was
established by Jneril fleeing Cloe II's non-Human suppressions in the early
600's. These Jneril refugees colonised St'ago, believing it's isolation
would offer them a safe haven from persecution. The Terran Empire intended to
colonise the Finger in the 1100's, but the onset of the Second Dark Age put
an end to any such schemes. During the Second Dark Age the Jneril on St'ago
used recovered jump drives to colonise two nearby worlds in the Finger. In
2153T, these worlds joined to form the Sinor Dkars (Dkars Alliance) to resist
the percieved threat from the reformed Magellanic Empire. It is this state
that has lead to small settlements on a few of the other worlds in the
Finger, as a trade route between the Sinor Dkars and the worlds on the
Homeward side of the Rift is slowly developing.

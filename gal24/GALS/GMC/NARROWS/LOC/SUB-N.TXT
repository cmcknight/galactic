Pathway District
----------------
Like the adjacent Iron Gate district, the Pathway district was first
colonised as part of the Terran Empire's push across the Diska Rift. Given
it's strategic nature it was more fully colonised than the Iron Gate, but
settlement was still relatively sparse. The district suffered badly during
the First Mwoah War with several worlds being the target of heavy nuclear
bombardments by the Mwoah. After the War it fell within the Mwoah sphere of
influence, but the lack of resources prevented the Mwoah from intergrating
the district into the Unity; rather they extracted a general commitment of
soverignty from most worlds, intending to absorb them at a later date.
However during the Second Mwoah War, the Magellanic Empire succeded in
forcing the Unity from much of the district.

The Unity still retains control over a number of strategic worlds located in
the district and these have now been fully absorbed into the Unity and their
previous Human inhabitants deported to reservations. Anti-Mwoah feeling still
remains high on the Human worlds in the district, but it is tempered by the
reality of the proximity and sensativity of the Unity.

Croki District
--------------
The Croki district is, as far as can be determined, totally uninhabited by
any intelligent life. Stabin lies deep within the Rift and is almost totally
inaccessable, but the other worlds form the end of the Zral Finger. These
worlds were surveyed at near the end of the Terran period and there were
plans to exploit the entire Zral Finger. However, like some many of the plans
for this sector, these came to naught with the collapse of the Terran Empire.

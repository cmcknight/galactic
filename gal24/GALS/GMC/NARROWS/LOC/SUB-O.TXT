Civtra District
---------------
The Civtra district is the flashpoint of the Narrows Sector. Most worlds are
members of the Civtra Confederation with it's capital at Avoytha. Formed in
2362T, the Confederation is a major Diadochi state friendly to the Magellanic
Empire. The Confederation grew out of a defensive alliance under Avoythan
prompting and is strongly expanisonistic, especially towards the Human worlds
in the neighbouring Pathway and Isalon districts. The Mwoah Unity has refused
to acknowledge the legitamacy of the Confederation, claiming it's existance
is a serious breach of the Treaty of Karin. The Magellanic Empire refutes
this, claiming it has no ties with the Confederation (whilst this may be
true in the strictest terms, considerable informal ties do exist).

The district is otherwise notable for it's sizeable Jneril minority. A number
of worlds in the district were colonised by Jneril refugees fleeing Cloe II's
alien supression campaigns in the early 600's and they remained after the
Terrans began colonisation during the late Imperial period. Jneril currently
comprise approximately 8% of the district's population. It is also
interesting to note that the Confederation world of Darby has a small
Mwoah minority (around 1% of it's population). The Confederation is very
secretive about these citizens, but it would appear that they are the
descendents of dissidents who fled the Unity between the two Mwoah Wars. As
far as is known, these are the only Mwoah ever to have choosen to do so.

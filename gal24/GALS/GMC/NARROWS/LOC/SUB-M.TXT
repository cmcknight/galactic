Iron Gate District
------------------
The Iron Gate district was the scene of some of the most fiercely fought
battles of both the First and Second Mwoah Wars. The district was sparsely
colonised early in the Terran Empire's push across the Diska Rift, but was
generaly only poorly developed with the Terrans prefering to colonise the
richer worlds on the homeward side of the rift. During the Second Dark Age
these worlds suffered badly and only began to recover after the IMSC started
to reestablish the jump 2 route. However this recovery was cut short by the
outbreak of the First Mwoah War. After the War many worlds in the district
were absorbed by the Mwoah Unity and a small group of Mwoah worlds still
exist in the edgeward corner of the district. However during the Second
Mwoah War the Magellanic Empire forced the Unity from most of the district
and the Treaty of Karin established it as part of the demilitarised zone
between the Empire and the Unity.

Drrell District
---------------
The Drrell district is the heartland of the Mwoah Unity in the Narrows. Like
the adjecent Oamwis district it was first colonised by humans during the late
Terran period and it's subsequent history basically mirrors that of Oamwis.
It was also one of the major battlegrounds of the First Mwoah War and fell to
the Unity after the war. During the Second Mwoah War the human populatons of
Drrell and the adjacent Oamwis districts actively supported the Magellanic
Empire against the Mwoah. As a result, the original human inhabitants of both
Drrell and Oamwis were moved to the five "reservation" worlds (Calon, Brewa,
Rhuna and Hwalar in the Drrell district and Grawil in the Oamwis district).
These worlds are administered by a Mwoah Governor, directly responsible to
the Council of Nine. However they are allowed a small degree of local
autonomy in internal matters. Despite this anti-Mwoah feeling runs high on
these worlds and they are prime recruiting grounds for the Human League; an
anti-Mwoah terrorist group active in the Narrows. The Human League also has
wide support on the independent human world of Sheffield, though the movement
is officially suppressed.

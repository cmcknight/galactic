Ultia District
--------------
The Ultia district has been the scene of a recent increase in tensions
between the Magellanic Empire and the Mwoah Unity over the incorporation of
Mukden into the Empire in 2362T. This has placed the forward Mwoah colonies
within 3 parsecs of Imperial forces. The coreward worlds in the district
were colonised by Terran refugees immediately after the fall of the Terran
Empire. The human populations of Somwah and Allis were subjegated by the
Mwoah shortly after the First Mwoah War. An uprising by the human population
of Somwah in 2228T lead to a brutal Mwoah response. Of the total human
population of 700,000 at that time, over 620,000 were killed as a reprisal
and the remainder transported as forced labourers to worlds deep with in the
Unity. Currently the world's only inhabitants are a small Mwoah mining camp.
This atrocity still fuels much of the anti-Mwoah feeling amongst the Human
population of the Cloud.

Isalon District
---------------
The Isalon district is mostly comprised of independent Human worlds, first
colonised during the late Terran Imperial period. The district has remained
a sleepy backwater until recently. Spared from the fighting during both the
Mwoah Wars, the inhabitants have choosen to take a low profile in the recent
increase in tensions between the Mwoah Unity and the Civtra Confederation.
However many analyists see this as one of the most likely battlegrounds in
any future conflict between them. Naturally most of the district's inhabitants
are less than enthused by this prospect and there is considerable hostility
towards both parties.

The district is home to a native minor race, the Mtshali of Mtshal. They are
descended from an omnivorious/gather race. They had achieved a solid tech
level 1 before they were contacted by Terran explorers shortly before the
collapse of the Empire. They have remained largely undisturbed since that
time. Occasional ships do visit and Mtshali artifacts command a high price
amongst collectors, but they remain an isolated society content to remain on
their homeworld. Traders are advised to exercise caution in attempting to
contact the Mtshali, as they have a complex set of social customs and laws,
with severe penalties for infringments.

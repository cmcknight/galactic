Desolation district
-------------------
The Desolation district is only sparsely developed. The Alana and Finnegan
were colonised during the late Terran period and are occasionally visited by
traders. Guilia was colonised during the early Diadochi period by miners who
make a living exploiting the rich deposits of radioactives found there.
However traffic volumes within the district are extremely low; and it would
be rare for any world to be visted by more than four or five ships per year.

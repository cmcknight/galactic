Oamwis District
---------------
The Oamwis district is entirely controlled by the Mwoah Unity. Located at the
homeward end of the jump 2 route across the Rift, the district is a vital
strategic link in the Unity's expansion plans. The district was first
colonised by Terrans during the late Terran period along with much of the
rest of the sector; and likewise it was cut off during the Second Dark Age.
Contact was reestablished during the mid 2100's as part of the IMSC's push
across the Rift. However the district became one of the major battlegrounds
during the resulting First Mwoah War and suffered accordingly. After the War
the district had been conquered by the Mwoah and was slowly absorbed into the
Unity. Due to human support for the Magellanic Empire in the Second Mwoah War
the Unity insituted it's infamous "reservation" policy. The human populations
of Oamwis and Drrell were deported to reservation worlds such as Grawil and
others in the adjacent Drrell district and Mwoah colonists installed in their
place. These reservation worlds are administered directly by the Unity and
access to them is restricted.

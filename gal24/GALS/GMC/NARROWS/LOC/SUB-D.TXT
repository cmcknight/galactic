Wallace District
----------------
The Wallace district is dominated by the expansionistic Aragi Dominion. The
Dominion was formed in 2183T when Aragi recieved jump drives from the IMSC.
During the First Mwoah War the Dominion remained neutral and after the war
they allied themselves with the Mwoah Unity (one of the few Human states to
do so). The Dominion has expanded to control the entire Aragi cluster with
the conquest of Zarkov in 2351T. The Dominion retains it control by force
and intimdation; and opposition to it is widespread, with ongoing uprisings
on Nausom, Carita and Zarkov.

Opposition outside the Dominion is lead by Torrance and Charleston who are
attempting to organise a defensive alliance amongst the other worlds. However
as yet these efforts have failed to produce any tangable results, with most
worlds trusting to the three parsec barrier between the Dominion and the rest
of the district.

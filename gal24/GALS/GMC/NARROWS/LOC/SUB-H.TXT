Ekakhir District
----------------
The Ekakhir district was first settled during the late Terran period. It was
abandoned during the collapse of the Terran Empire, but it still retains it's
overwhelmingly Terran nature. The district was one of the first recontacted
by the IMSC after the foundation of the Magellanic Empire and was one of it's
staunchest bastions of support during both the First and Second Mwoah Wars.
Whilst no formal multilateral treaty or agreement exist between the various
worlds of this district, there is an informal understanding to co-operate in
the event on a Mwoah attack on any world. This informal agreement has acted
as an effective deterent from aggression. This informal agreement has also
acted to limit internal conflict within the district.

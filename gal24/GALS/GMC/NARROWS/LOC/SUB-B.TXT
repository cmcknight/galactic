Great Ocean District
--------------------
The Great Ocean district has never been settled by any interstellar race. It
was briefly surveyed during the Terran period, when the minor race on Copyn
was noted. The Copynri had achieved a basic bronze age culture at that time,
but were otherwise unremarkable and they were left in peace, unaware of
interstellar civilisation. A brief IMSC survey of Copyn in 2107T noted no
major advances in Copynri development. As far as is known, there has been no
further contact with the Copynri.

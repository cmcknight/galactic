Multon District
---------------
The Multon district is virtually unexploited. Colonies exist on Agata and
Kuse, but the rich worlds of the Cuba cluster remain untouched. Agata was
colonised during the late Terran period as a prelude to exploitation of the
Cuba culster, but these plans came to nothing. Unusually, Kuse was colonised
during the Second Dark Age, but it's development is still limited. Biometrika
is inhabited by refugees from the Aragi Dominion; as yet the Dominion appears
to be content to leave them alone.

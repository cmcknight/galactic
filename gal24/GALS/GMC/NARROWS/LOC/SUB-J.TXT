Dela District
-------------
This district is virtually empty void, only having one sytem (Koringap)
within it's boundaries. Koringap was colonised in 1247T by accident when the
Terran Ship of the Line HIMS Koringap misjumped and found itself stranded in
the system. The crew established a colony on the single world orbiting the
dim M9V star which has remained to this day.

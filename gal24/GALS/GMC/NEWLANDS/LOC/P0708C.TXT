The R-7855T the major research centre of the Principality of Tzu Hui. The
belt is also rich in resources, containing extensive deposits of rare earth
metals. Currently, R-7855T is heavily involved in research into quantum
spatial-temporal physics, especially wormhole physics. R-7855T has recently
become a major target in the increasingly intense 'cold war' between the
Principality of Tzu Hui and the Archduchy of Margaret (which has the covert
backing of the Principality of Breakout). As a result of this security at the
R-7855T centre has been stepped up over the past decade and the local
authorities will tend to shoot first and ask questions later. A small manned
contingent has recently been added to the interdiction squadron, this
consists of three tech level 11 sloops.

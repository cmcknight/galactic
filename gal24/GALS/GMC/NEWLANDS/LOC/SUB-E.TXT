Firstfall District
------------------
Part of the heartland of the Empire, Firstfall is a heavily populated
and very civilised district. Breakout was the site of the first Terran
colony in the Cloud and the Principality of Breakout is the most
powerful member of the Empire. However the bulk of the District's worlds
are located in the Edgeward portion of the District. This area is dominated
by the rivalry between the Principality of Tzu Hui and the Grand Duchy of
Margaret. These two Diadochi states have fought two inconclusive wars in
the past 100 years and tensions between the two states remains high.

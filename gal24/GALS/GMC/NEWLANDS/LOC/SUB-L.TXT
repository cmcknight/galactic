Diska's Folly District
----------------------
Located on the Edge of the Diska Rift, the Diska's Folly District was
first settled during the Late Imperial Period. Most worlds in the District
display a level of xenophobia not found elsewere in the Empire. The
District suffered very badly during the Second Dark Age, and has still
not truely recovered. Eyakhir has a unique culture. Settled by Akhrini
disidents during the Late Imperial period, Eyakhir is the home of the
Reakhera, noted for their strong pro-Imperial sentiments. The Reakhera have
retained their distincitve culture and several Reakhera settlements exist
on other Imperial worlds.

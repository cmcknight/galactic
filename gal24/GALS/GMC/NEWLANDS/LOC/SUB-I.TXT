Starlane District
-----------------
Starlane, along with the Veran District, form the Breakout cultural
region. Colonised during the Early Imperial Period, Starlane is part
of the Imperial Heartland. These worlds were the first to accead to
the Babylon Accords. Three states dominate this region: the Corinthian
Union, the Grand Duchy of Thebes and the Principality of Breakout.
Whilst overt conflict is rare, these states frequently engage in economic
warfare. The upper ranks of the Magellanic Navy are dominated by officers
from the Breakout cultural region. The King Charles III squadron is
almost exclusively recruited from the Breakout region.

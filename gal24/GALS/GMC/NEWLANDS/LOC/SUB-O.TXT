Britannia District
------------------
The Britannia District is dominated by the Single world of Middlesex, though
recently the Duchy of Wessex has begun to challange this dominance. Much
recent tension has revolved around the dominance of the rich resources of
the Brecknock belt (location of the largest Lanthium deposits within the
Empire). Middlesex is the major supporter of the unpopular current Earl
of Brecknock against Wessex.

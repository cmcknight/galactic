Efpora District
---------------
Efpora was initially settled by Efrip refugues fleeing the collapse of the
First Efrip Council. However little of their culture remains, having been
swamped by Terran colonists during the Early Terran Period. The Efrip remain
as an underclass, dominated by the Terrans. Efpora is most noted for the
rich mines of Perdita and Gaulois. The three Coreward worlds are considered
to be part of the Imperial heartland and have a radically different culture
from the rest of the District.

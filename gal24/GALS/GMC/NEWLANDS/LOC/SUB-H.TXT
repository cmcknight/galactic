Empty Quarter District
----------------------
Part of the Diska Rift, the Empty Quarter is a poorly developed region.
Its culture is unique in the Empire, having been settled by refugues from
the Terran Civil Wars just before the collapse of the Wormhole. The
inhabitants of the District stress non-violence and cooperation. The
District is pleasantly free of the strife and conflict the plague the
rest of the Empire. The District is renowned for its artists and
philosophers.

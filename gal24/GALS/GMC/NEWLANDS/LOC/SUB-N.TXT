Dilly District
--------------
The Dilly district is dominated by the Faorin Confederation and the
Principality of Sodor. Both states are hostile to one another and there
have been several wars (the most recent ended in 2351T). The continuing
tensions are causing some serious harm to the District's economy, with
frequent raids and acts of sabotage. The Pricipality of Sodor is dominated
by the racist anti-Jneril Terran Purity Movement. Most commentators agree
that it is only a matter of time before another war erupts.

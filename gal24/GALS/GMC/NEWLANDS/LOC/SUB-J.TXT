Veran District
--------------
Part of the Breakout cultural region, the Veran District is a highly
civilised region with a long history of Terran settlement. Totaly
dominated by the Principality of Breakout, Veran is one of the more
peaceful Districts in the Empire. Veran is home to the newest Diadochi
State (the Duchy of Cuzco), formed under the tutalage of Breakout in
2362T. Trade and transport within the District is almost totaly controlled
by Expidor Lines, a cause of much local resentment.

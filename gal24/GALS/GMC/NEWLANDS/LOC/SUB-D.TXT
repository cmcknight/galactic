Mehrtz District
---------------
Traditionally dominated by the Karadzic Empire, the Mehrtz district has
long been ignored by the Empire. However the recent growth of Saladin has
lead to an major increase in activity. Settled in the Middle Imperial
period, culturally Mehrtz has much in common with the Lango District, but
with a much more frontier bent. The district is regarded as a sleepy
backwater by most of the Empire, but its inhabitants have a fierce pride
in their independence.

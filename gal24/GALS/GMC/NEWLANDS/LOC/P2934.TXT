IMSC NOTICE OF HAZARDOUS NAVIGATION ZONE
Location: Iiebo, Newlands 2934
Nature of Hazard: Collapse of Local Order
Date of notification: 297-2365T

As a result of the recent use of nuclear weapons on Iiebo {Newlands 2934}, the
IMSC regrets to announce that until further notice the Iiebo system must be
considered to be a hazardous navigation zone. Travellers are urged to avoid
entry into the system if at all possible and to excerise due caution if such
entry is neccessary. With the destruction of JJ Burnel Starport in 2367T no
facilities remain in system to support the operation of space going craft.
Travellers may expect to encounter extreme local civil disorder and the planet
should be considered to be a war zone.

Updates regarding the situation on Iiebo may be obtained from the IMSC base
on Owen {Newlands 2833} for a cost of Cr 200.

Mitre District
--------------
A sparsely settled backwater, Mitre has never really been developed. Mitre
was settled during the early part of the Second Dark Age and still has
a strong independent culture. Mitre is currently undergoing a minor boom
due to Imperial attempts to forge an alternate route through or around the
Diska Rift with the development of J-3 drives. The Lanthium mines on Latorre
are a major factor in the district's economy.

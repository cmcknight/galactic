In 2362T a vicious civil war broke out on Iiebo. Initialy the war, while
being quite savage, was a fairly standard affair. However in 2365T one of the
faction started to employ nuclear weapons. The situation quickly esculated
and the system was posted as an amber zone. Civil admistration and all
cembilance of law and order quickly broke down. In 2366T a nuclear strike
destroyed the C class JJ Burnel starport. The final breakdown came in late
2366T and lead to the withdrawal of most offworld representation.

Currently the world is dominated by a large number of local warlords of
dubious legitamacy, many of these claim Imperial noble titles but only a
handful are recongised by the Imperial Collage of Heralds. approximately 30%
to 50% of the world's population has perished in the war and no end is yet in
sight. The last use of nuclear weapons was is 2368T and Iiebo has now lost the
capacity to manufacture more of these weapons but some no doubt still remain.
Iiebo's industrial capacity has all but been destroyed during the war and the
warlords now rely on outworld imports to sustain themselves. It is expected
that it will be several decades at the very least before Iiebo can rejoin the
interstellar community.

Jnisck District
---------------
The Jnisck District is noted for its large Jneril minority. A Jneril state
(the Shirk Agor - Agor Council) is located here. Prior to the Second Mwoah
War, the tensions between the Empire and the Agor Council were fairly high,
but with the Empire's intervention to aid the Jneril on Hreli, relations
have improved dramatically over the last 70 years. The Agor Council is
now one of the Empire's closest allies. The District is cuturally part of
the Coreward cultural region, heavily influenced by Jneril stoasim, though
the Jneril concepts of democracy have made less of an impact. Despite the
improved relations with the Jneril, the anti-Jneril Terran Purity Movement
is still very strong throughout the District.

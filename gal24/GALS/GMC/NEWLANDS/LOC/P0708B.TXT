R-7855T is the site of a Tzu Hui Research Center.

The interdiction is maintained by a number of automated interdiction
satellites. These satellites are armed with nuclear missiles. Ships
entering the system will recieve one warning to refuel and exit. Ships
failing to comply have a very high chance of being engaged regardless of
their circumstances. Ships which do not refuel and leave; and are not
engaged will be directed to the main base and the crew imprisoned until the
next supply ship can ferry them out. There is a good chance that the crew
will face criminal proceeding on Tzu Hui; and in any matter their ship will
be confescated.

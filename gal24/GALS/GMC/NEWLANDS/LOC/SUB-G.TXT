Caro District
-------------
The Caro District consists of a developed region to Homeward and a number
of worlds isolated in the Yumazaca Void. The region is dominted by the
expansionistic Caro Dominion. The Dominion has recently conqured Koka
(2364T) and a vicious guerilla war continues on the world. Most of the
other worlds in the District support the guerillas on Koka, seeking to
halt the Dominions expansion.

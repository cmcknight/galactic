Lango District
--------------
Lango is a vital link between the Newlands and Yamazaca sectors. Initially
settled during the Middle Terran Imperial period, the culture owes much to
that era. Langians are generally regarded as being staid and conservative.
Langian culture is best described as being restrained, free from much of
the overt competition that is a feature of the general Magellanic culture.
However this does not mean that the District is free of conflict. The
Langians have raised espionage to a high art. Langians regard the less
subtle ways of the Magellanic Diadochi as brutish and inelegant.

Strali District
---------------
A curious district, the Edge-Voidward portion is part of the Imperial
heartland and considered to be part of the Firstfall cultural region.
However the bulk of the remaining worlds are isolated in the Yamazaca Void.
The Edgeward portion of the District is dominated by the Grand Duchy of
Margeret, whilst the Coreward worlds are part of the Breakout cultural
region. Strali is noted for two imperial installations, the IMSC maintain
their headquaters on Nemesis and the IMJ maintains its most secure and
notorious prison on MCN-378290, deep within the void.

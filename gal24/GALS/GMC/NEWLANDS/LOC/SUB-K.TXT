Wertya District
---------------
A vital commincations link between the civilised heartland of the Empire
and its Coreward frontier. Wertya is a cultural and trade crossroads.
Almost all cultures and races from the Empire can be found in Wertya.
Traditionally economically dominated by Expidor Lines, Wertya has recently
been the site of a fierce clash between Expidor and Kanto Trading as both
struggle to dominate this vital region.

Monta District
--------------
This District was the sight of the fiercest battles of the Second Mwoah War.
The District is still heavily militarised against the Mwoah threat. Gibraltar
is the start of the J-2 route across the Diska Rift; and was besieged during
both the First and Second Mwoah Wars. Between the 2340's and 2360's there was
a slight improvement in relations with the Mwoah Unity and an increase in
trade, but recent times have seen tensions increase and trade has fallen off,
precipitating the District into a minor economic depression. As a result,
anti-Mwoah feeling runs high, especially on the Jneril world of St'iyha.

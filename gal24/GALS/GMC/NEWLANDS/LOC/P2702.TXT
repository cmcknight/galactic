IMSC NOTICE OF INTERDICTED WORLD
Interdicted world: Jakob, Newlands 2702
Reason for Interdiction: Suppression of Rebellion
Interdiction authorised by: Mary, Empress of Karadzic
Date of authorisation of interdiction: 232-2367T

The Karadzic Empire has declared that access to the Jakob system is
restricted until further notice. Normal access to the system is permitted for
purposes of refueling, but approach to within 100 plantary diameters of Jakob
itself is a capital offense under Karadzic jurisprudence (offenders may be
executed summarily). Any ship arriving in system is required to transmit its
idenity, destination and point of origin to the Military System Control
Authority immediately. Any vessel failing to comply will be destroyed without
warning.

The IMSC advises extreme caution at all times.

DISCLAIMER: THE INCLUSION OF THIS INTERDICTION NOTICE ON ANY STARCHART DOES
NOT IN ANY WAY INDICATE ANY IMSC ENDORSEMENT OF THE LEGITAMACY OF ANY SUCH
INTERDICTION.

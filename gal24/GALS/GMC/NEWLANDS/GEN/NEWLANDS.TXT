The Newlands sector
-------------------
The Newlands sector can be considered to be the cradle of the Terrans in the
Cloud. It was the site of the first Terran settlements within the Cloud, it
retained the spark of Terran civilisation throughout the Second Dark Age, and
it was the first sector to join current Magellanic Empire. The sector is the
centre of Terran power in the Cloud, dominated by the various Diadochi states
that have emerged from the Second Dark Age.

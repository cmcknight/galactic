This parsec is empty, except for a warship which misjumped here
several years back. It was during an attack from Gresson's Worlds
against the Ionian Republic, and during the battle, the fleet was
forced with withdraw. Unfortunately, their main carrier didn't
make it, and was presumed lost. The admiral in charge of the
expedition realized that because of the proximity of the
nebula, she couldn't communicate home, so he sent a plea for
assistance to the nearest neutral star system, the ordered her
crew into cold sleep. Somehow, Ionian agents found out about the
communique, and an Ionian taskforce has claimed salvage rights
and evacuated the crew for interrogation. The drives are so
badly mangled, however, that it is unlikely that the vessel will
ever jump again, so only the most valuable components are being
taken.

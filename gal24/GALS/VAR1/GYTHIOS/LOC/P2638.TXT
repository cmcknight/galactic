Thorp was settled nearly a century ago by settlers from what
would later become the Ionian Republic. The world was initially
resistant to becoming a member of the republic, but encroachment
by the dictatorship of Gresson's Worlds changed their mind.

The "Thorps", as they are called, still feel an affiliation
with the neutral worlds in this subsector, particularly with
Steorra & Fogter, since both worlds have always had friendly
relations with them. As for democracy, however, much of the
population looks upon it as a farce, as they have to cope
with a military governor, at least until their application
as a full status member of the republic goes through the
Ionian government.

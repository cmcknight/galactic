
EnkiLab
-------

EnkiLab is small bio-lab funded by the BioGen Corporation for the
purpose of remotely testing BioGen pharmaceuticals. In order for
the company to get its drugs approved quickly, it has become
necessary to pre-test them on human subjects prior to sending the
drugs through normal Imperial channels (this can take years,
particularly if unforseen side-effects are noticed which must
then be studied and deemed either hazardous or benign). BioGen
gets its test subjects from Raleigh. These people are mainly
prisoners who have been convicted on one crime or another, but
who's sentences have been commuted because of their willingness
to participate as guinea pigs. Most of these subject are put
through trials of relatively benign drugs on the planet of
Raleigh, however, a few of the more violent criminals are
secretly transported to EnkiLab where they serve as test subjects
for more dangerous bio-chemicals. This "dark side" of BioGen's
business is kept well-away from the public eye, and the company
officials who know about it believe they are doing humanity a
service by getting rid of these criminals in a productive way
which will further the progress of science.

Unknown to them, however, is that part of this progress entails
viral research. Lord Trulane, one of the company stockholders who
was chiefly responsible for setting up the lab, has staffed the
lab with "his people", scientists who are personally loyal to him
and who keep quiet about the viral research which is conducted
(even when other company-people show up).

Currently stationed at the lab are:

1. Roland Karter, Biologist
2. Janet Magalia, Biologist
3. Dimitri Gustafson, Surgeon
4. Uri Narsini, Virus Specialist
5. Tula Pierce, Virus Specialist
6. Betty Yolan, Medical Technician
7. Gregor Malivich, Engineer
8. Thomas Jakobson, Security Guard

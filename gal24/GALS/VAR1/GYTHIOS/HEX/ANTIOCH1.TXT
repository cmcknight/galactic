
Harvestown
----------

Harvestown was originally a scientific outpost; its mission: to
catalog the various bacteria which were native to the planet. In
the process of doing their work, however, the researchers stumbled
across an extremely fast-growing variety of algae which was ideally
suited to the world's thin, primordial atmosphere, and it was
determined that the species was highly nutritious and could be farmed
for sustinence. This attacted the interest of the Better Foods
Corporation which leased rights to the world and set up a refinery
on the site of the original outpost. This eventually grew into
Harvestown.

Twenty years ago, Better Foods' lease expired, and its interests in
Antioch reverted to the inhabitants. The world went from a corporate
government to a balkanized one involving a number of "city-states".
Harvestown is the largest of these, with a population of about 300,000.

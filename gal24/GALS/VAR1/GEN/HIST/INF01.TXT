
[2004-2007 The Glowing War]

The 3rd Millennium kicked off with a bang, when in its first
decade both Paris and New York fell victim to nuclear terrorism.
The blow to the western psyche was heartfelt, yet the fear the
terrorists hoped to illicit was replaced only by anger in the
wake of the destruction. A handful of nations were held
responsible for backing the terrorists, and repercussions were
both swift and certain. Through a combination of neutron and
bacteriological strikes, the so-called offending nations were
decimated and a virtual moratorium on nuclear weapons was called
for by the seven superpowers. A policy of Cooperative
Guardianship was ruthlessly enforced by the superpowers in order
to maintain the nuclear free world.

With the beanstalk's finalization in '97, space imports grew at
an alarming rate, flushing out entire earth-bound industries as
the use of mutant labor gave off-world firms a competitive
advantage. Mitsubishi invested heavily in offworld trade and
transport, sinking considerable assets into a major corporate
gamble. During this period, samples of alien lifeforms began
appearing on earth. Some were sold for research, but others were
distributed through the black market to wealthy collectors for
exorbitant prices.

   Although most of these organisms proved less hardy than their
Terran equivalents, wide-spread outcry resulted concerning the
public's protection. Following the discovery of a primitive alien
society on Darwin IV, the U.N. instated the Orbital Quarantine
Command as a protective measure against the infestation of alien
organisms. However, the passage of the Nakamura Resolution in '63
caused the OQC to evolve into a protectionist trade barrier,
crippling off-world industry from doing business in the Terran
market.

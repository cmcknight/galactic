The so-called peace following the Glowing War was short-lived.
For another two decades, as the ability to produce
bacteriological weapons became available to the developing
nations through numerous advances in medical science, a series of
germ wars plagued the earth. By the middle 30's, the death toll
was three billion people. The wars resulted in tremendous
biomedical advances in the more advanced nations, however the
third world nations rarely benefitted from new discoveries and
were the hardest hit. Although relatively minor outbreaks
occurred later in the century resulting in half a billion more
fatalities, the wars were said to officially end with the Treaty
of New Delhi in 2034 when India unveiled the Yama Bug, a class of
germs with theoretically no possible immunization or antidote.
Such a germ had already existed in the more developed nations for
several decades, but never before had its release been
threatened. The Prime Minister's statement, "If India dies, the
whole world dies," brought an abrupt halt to the self-inflicted
genocide.


[2251-2292  Children of the Apes]

With the road to human genetic development legally cut short in
2243, many human engineers found themselves squeezed out of the
private sector. One such scientist, Dr. Ukliv Eski, returned to
the academia where he founded the Department of Hominid Studies
at the University of Kampala. There, his research team raised
several generations of chimpanzees, the genetic structure of
which he successively modified toward humanity's own. By 2289,
his chimps gained international notoriety on a holovideo talk
show where on several occasions they argued the world issues
with political leaders, the implicit parody of the situation
flustering their opponents and creating a media circus. Although
never progressing beyond a grade school intelligence, the chimps
ingratiated themselves into their hearts of the common people.
However, in a biological mishap at the University in 2292, the
chimps and their trainers, including Dr. Eski, were killed. Later
that year, the U.N. extended its 2243 prohibition on the genetic
manipulation of human DNA to cover the DNA of all hominid
species.

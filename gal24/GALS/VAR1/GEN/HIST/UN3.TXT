
[2825-2852  Renewed Faith]

With the discovery of Neanderthal in '25, not only did people
renew their speculation in the possibility of an alien
civilization, but many also renewed their faith in some form of
deity. The Catholic Pope, though his power had waned considerably
since the 25th Century, decreed that Neanderthal Man had not been
transplanted by aliens, but rather by God himself. When the alien
signaling device was finally discovered twenty-seven years later,
the same Pope indicated that the discovery was of no special
significance except for the possibility that it might have been
put there by the devil to lure people away from their faith in
the Almighty.

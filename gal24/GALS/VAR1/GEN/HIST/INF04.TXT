
[2068-2088  Only One Earth]

In 2068, the nine superpowers joined in a treaty known as the
Green Pact which was to later evolve into the Only One Earth
restoration campaign. As the global-warming crisis continued
unabated, the world community cooperated in the implementation of
long-term solutions to the greenhousing of the earth's atmosphere
and the environmentally sound disintegration or holding of toxic
substances. Although initially greeted with mixed support, the
efforts of this campaign were finally joined by the remaining
nations in 2088, instituting policies of renewal over the entire
planet.


[2710-2741  Open Defiance]

With the success of the Martian accords, the terraformation of
Mars, Venus, and Titan which all began in the early 23rd century
neared the completion stages. However, the inner-system
importation of mutants in the early part of the 28th century
led the U.N. to threaten police action for the violation of the
standard-human zone. Aster and Femm agreed to submit the issue
for arbitration, but only to a non-Terran arbitration council.
The U.N. refused to agree to this condition, and sent warships to
enforce its will. Before they arrived, however, Femm's public
affairs office, on Earth, threatened the release of undisclosed
biological contaminants if the Terran warships reached their
destination. The threat was later proven a bluff, but it gave the
big three time to organize fleets within the solar system,
resulting in the 2nd Martian accords of 2741.


[2568-2597  The Beanstalk]

With the 2568 U.N. creation of a standard-human zone around
Earth, advancing biogenetics was effectively forced off-planet,
causing the displacement of tens of millions of highly educated
corporate personnel. With the sudden influx of out-world traffic,
combined with the industrial, service, and clerical personnel who
were sure to follow, the U.N. stepped up plans for the renovation
of the world spaceport, culminating in the construction of what
was to become popularly known as the Beanstalk, a ground to space
station over seventy thousand kilometers in overall length.


[2084-2102  The Farmers' Rebellions]

In the years before the establishment of the world e-grid,
particularly during the middle stages of the Only One Earth
Campaign, the emerging energy-confederation began reclaiming
large areas of infertile land traditionally used for small-scale
subsistence farming. In so doing, the land was once again made
fertile for collective farming, however, hundreds of millions of
small-time farmers were displaced. This sudden shift in the
social order created a people entirely dispossessed, and in the
resulting chaos, a number of rebellions broke out beginning in
2084 and continued sporadically for eighteen years until the
Nolanders' rebellion was ruthlessly crushed in 2102.

This sector first appeared in Supplement 10 - Solomani Rim and was intially
developed by John Harshman in 1982. This version covers the sector at the
time of first contact between the Terrans and the Vilani. It was redeveloped
for the Interstellar Wars era in 1998 by Andrew Moffatt-Vallance from the
Milieu Zero data of Micheal Bailey.

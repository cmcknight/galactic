Desginer Notes

These notes are part of the rough draft from my Prometheus Rising project
(intended as a "definitive" coverage of the period). I've included them to
help make the maps more usable. However it should be noted that:

  1 - This entire project is completely "unofficial" (though I live in hope)
  2 - These notes are only a rough draft and are therefore liable to change
      before I'm finished
  3 - These notes are only a very small part of the project

However these notes do help to make sense of the maps and all the "basic"
plot elements are unlikely to change. I hope people find the maps and notes
useful and if you have any comments please feel free to contact me.

Topic's likely to be covered in Prometheus Rising include:
  The rest of the wars
  The "Barnard Incident"
  The Terran "Free Traders"
  Terran Biomedical technology
  Sharurshid and its presence in the rim
  The Intelligence War and agencies
  Personalities of the Wars
  The Vegans
There will probably be more as the project develops.

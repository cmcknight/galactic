The government of the Ziru Sirka was theoretically a centralised bureacracy.
However the sheer distances involved in the adimistration of the Empire had
lead to considerable authority being devolved to many worlds, to the extent
that many worlds had essentially achieved local autonomy. This was especially
true near the frontiers. Therefore, the usual government codes require some
expansion with regards to the Ziru Sirka.

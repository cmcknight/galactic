Thorstone Subsector
-------------------
This subsector contains some Imperial worlds which are an extension of the
Outreamer subsector of the Ley sector and are administered from Arsouf. Petra
maintains a scout base and Cairo maintains a naval base as the Ginlenchy
Concordance is a potential trouble source. All the rest of the worlds with
the exception of Marchand are members of the Ginlenchy Concordance.

The Thorstone subsector contains 27 worlds with a total population of 2.3
billion. The highest population is 8, at Fatima, Paramond, Liana, Bairdis,
and Marchand; the highest tech level is D ar Cairo.

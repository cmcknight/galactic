Glowing Subsector
-----------------
The Glowing subsector is mostly empty Lesser Rift with three systems of the
Krax Confederation intruding to the trailing spinward corner. The systems
here, though scattered, are fairly rich. The necessity for jump 4 to navigate
this area has limited commerce in this region but has also limited conflicts.

The Glowing subsector contains 9 worlds with a total population of 56 billion.
The highest population is a, at Platteworld; the highest tech level is D, at
Platteworld and Reinbear.

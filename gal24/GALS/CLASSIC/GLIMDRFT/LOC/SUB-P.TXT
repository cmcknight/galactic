Daro Subsector
--------------
The Daro subsector is mostly independent systems except for three systems in
the extreme trailing rim centre. Little activity of note has ever taken place
in this subsector but latent conflicts are coming to a head. War is
anticipated within the next few years. The independent systems have been
hiring mercenary training cadres. The three systems of the Rm Nai view the
squabbling inhabitants of these independent systems with great disdain.

The Daro subsector contains 19 worlds with a total population of 2 billion.
The highest population is 8, at Polydor, Bangor and Manawater; the highest
Tech level is D, at Autonomy and Norfolk.

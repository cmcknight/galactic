Tri-Empire Subsector
--------------------
The name of this subsector refers to a previous era of history where it
appeared three seperate Empires would develop and meet in this area. Now the
only Empire is a small section of the Imperium frontier administered from
Sledgetower in Diamond-Prince subsector. The Marlan Primate extends into this
area and coordinates the members of the Ginlenchy Concordance with active
assistance from the Imperium.

The Tri-Empire subsector contains 20 worlds with a total population of 59
billion. The highest population is A at Macelight; the highest tech level is
D, at Macelight and Ixobis-Rit.

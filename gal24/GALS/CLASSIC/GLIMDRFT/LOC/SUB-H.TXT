Tasman Subsector
----------------
All worlds in this subsector are members of or are claimed by the Mandanin
Co-Dominion. This area was primarily occupied and developed during the
previous peaceful expansion.

The Tasman subsector contains 36 worlds with a total population of 105
billion. It is a deliberate policy not to discriminate between the two species
even in overall population figures. The highest population is A, at Carpathia;
the highest Tech level is B, at Niv, Esefer, Coneworld, Oblast, Usob, New
Virginia and Appalachia.

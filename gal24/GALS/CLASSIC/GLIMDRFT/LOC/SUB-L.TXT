Ryazan Subsector
----------------
The Ryazan subsector is an area of independent planets except for two systems
to coreward in the Mandanin Co-Dominion. Development of the systems in this
area over the last two centuries has lead to some recent armed clashes
between Co-Dominion and independent forces. The independents have sometimes
drawn support from the Krax Confederation.

The Ryazan subsector contains 23 worlds with a total population of 79 billion.
The highest population is A, at Ryazan; the highest Tech level is C, at Tai
Hu, Winooski, and Kara Su.

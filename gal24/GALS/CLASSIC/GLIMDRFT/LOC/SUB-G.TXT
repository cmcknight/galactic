Williamsburg Subsector
----------------------
The Williamsburg subsector has been the scene of intense commercial and
politicial rivalry in the past. The arrangement of the Ginlenchy Concordance
in 842 greatly lowred the incidence of armed conflict in that area. An area
of contention still exists on the Trailing edge of the subsector where the
Mandanin Co-Dominion has recently expanded to take over several systems.

The Williamsburg subsector contains 33 worlds with a total population of 110
billion. The highest population is A at Williamsburg and Tschen; the highest
Tech level is D, at Williamsburg and Lacako.

Marla Subsector
---------------
The Marla subsector is dominated by the Marlan Primate, a well organised and
stable theocracy. To spinward is a small extension of the Mandanin
Co-Dominion. Many planets to trailing edge of the subsector are disputed
between the two states. The current attitude is one of watchful caution on
both sides.

The Marla subsector contains 21 worlds with a total population of 81 billion.
The highest population is A, at Dorah; the highest tech level is F at
Parcensee and Inisheer.

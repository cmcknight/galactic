Kraxin Subsector
----------------
The Kraxian subsector is split between the Krax Confederation and the members
of the Ginlenchy Concordance. The Imperium is interested in maintaining a fair
degree of stability in this area, though there are few items of commercial
interest to the Impreium to be found here. Various members of the Krax
Confederation persue somewhat different policies towards the Concordance
making for somewhat confused relationships.

The Kraxian subsector contains 33 worlds with a total population of 83 billion.
The highest population is A, at Utigur; the highest tech level is E, at
Sporades and Utigur.

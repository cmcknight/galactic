Darkling Subsector
------------------
The Darkling subsector is completely a rift area of extremely low star
density. It is a quiet backwater of little political or commercial importance.
A small scout base on Depew maintains a loose Imperial surveillance on the
subsector.

The Darkling subsector contains 8 worlds with a total population of 90
million. The highest population level is 7, at Verglavia and Clearwater. The
highest tech level is C, at Kofu and Mantua.

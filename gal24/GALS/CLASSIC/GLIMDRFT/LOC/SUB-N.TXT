Zairae Subsector
----------------
The Zairae subsector has only three systems not in the Zarian Realm; Gorizia
and Fiume in the Krax Confederation and the independent Carla. The borders of
the Realm have been stable for over a thousand years. The Imperium has long
since agreed to the Realm's request to limit trade to Kali and Ko Hu.

The Zairae subsector contains 31 worlds with a total population of 474
billion. The highest population level is A, at Fiume, Keewat, Prospect,
Zipple, Suddengrave, and Swift; the highest Tech level is E at Hyde.

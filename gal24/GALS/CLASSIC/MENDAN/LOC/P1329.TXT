Allegiance: Julian Prot. (Lumda Dower)

Lumda is both the subsector capital and the capital of the Lumda Dower.  The
first settlement on Lumda was to exploit a rich find of minerals; it became
an administrative center during the Julian War and Antares Pacification
Campaign, as a result of the flight of refugees and the withdrawl of assets
from the rimward areas of the Protectorate.  Few of the planets in this 
subsector are associated with any of the interstellar polities that make up
the Julian Protectorate; rather, most maintain direct membership in the
Protectorate.

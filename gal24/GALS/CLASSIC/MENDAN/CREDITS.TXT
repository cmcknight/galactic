
Mendan Sector - Credits
-----------------------

The Mendan sector was originally published in Challenge 49.
v.m.patel@bradford.ac.uk typed in this sector some eons past
into a data format of his own design. Tetusu-Dene was covered in
Vilani & Vargr. Jeff Zeitlin (jeff.zeitlin@execnet.com) converted
the sector to Galactic format in 1997.

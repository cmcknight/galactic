Reft Sector - Credits
---------------------

The Reft Sector data was ftped from Sunbane.

Similar data seems to have been published in issue 20 of
The Travellers' Digest put out by Digest Group Publications
in July of 1990. The people involved in the Trojan Reach
write-up from that issue were James Holden, John Meyers,
and Mike Mikesh.

Christopher Thrash <thrash@io.com> wrote up some brief
world descriptions for the Islands clusters (in the Old
Islands & New Islands subsectors). These write-ups are
based on material published in Supplement 5, Trillion
Credit Squadron, p. 40-47. The descriptions themselves
are all quotes from the supplement, with three exceptions:  
(1) some minor rephrasing and repeating so the quotes make
sense out of context, (2) a few dates that are conjectural
(the founding of Esperanza, for example) but pretty
conservatively extrapolated from known data, and (3) the
definitions for the world names (Chris researched these
with help from the TML).

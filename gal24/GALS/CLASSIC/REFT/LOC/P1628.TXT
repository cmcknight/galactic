JOYEUSE
"Joyous" - Charlemagne's sword

Joyeuse was settled from Amondiage.

Straddling the divider between the New and Old Islands, Joyeuse
is a well-developed world with a government similar to that of
Esperanza (a well-entrenched non-charismatic dictatorship which
enforces an oppressive political structure).  It has a colony at
Quichotte, which voluntarily became a province.

St. Hilaire and Besancon were settled from Joyuese.

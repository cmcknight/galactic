HERZENLUST
"Heart's Desire"

Herzenlust was settled from Neubayern.

Most emigration has been from high-population worlds to others
already occupied but less crowded.  Sometime the new residents
have taken political control away from the original inhabitants;
New Colchis gained its colony of Herzenlust in this manner.

The coup on Herzenlust took place in 5576; when the government
declared allegiance to New Colchis, several signatories
repudiated the Concordat of Topas of 5542.

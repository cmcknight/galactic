TOPAS
"Topaz"

Zufluct was settled by refugees from a civil war on Topas;
Voyageur happened to arrive insystem looking for colonists just
as the war was ending.

When one planet has grown too powerful, the others have allied to
bring pressure to stop it, as happened to Serendip Belt in 5542,
when it was forced to give up its control of Topas, Elysee, and
Besancon.

The Concordat of Topas of 5542 established the principles of
plantary sovereignty.  It lasted until 5576, when a coup on
Herzenlust (and subsequent declaration of allegiance to New
Colchis by the new government) caused several signatories to
repudiate its terms.

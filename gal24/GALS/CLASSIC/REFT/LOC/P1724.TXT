STURGEON'S LAW
"Ninety percent of everything is crap."

Infinite forced down on Sturgeon’s Law in 5232.

In all their journeys, only one interstellar spaceship was lost: 
Infinite, from Amondiage, made a forced landing on Sturgeon’s Law
with a load of colonists from New Home.  Crew and colonists were
forced to settle on this uninviting planet and were cut off from
the outside for hundreds of years.  It was fortunate for them
that they landed in the planet’s single sea:  the plant-forms on
the land surface metabolize metal and human protoplasm with equal
ease.

ELYSEE
"Paradise"; also the French presidential palace


Elysee was settled from Besancon.

When one planet has grown too powerful, the others have allied to
bring pressure to stop it, as happened to Serendip Belt in 5542,
when it was forced to give up its control of Topas, Elysee, and
Besancon.

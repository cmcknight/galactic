SANSTERRE
"Landless"

Sansterre was settled from Amondiage.

A water world on the coreward edge of the Cluster, Sansterre is a
representative democracy with extensive underwater settlements
scattered all across the world’s ocean bottoms.  Its major
resource colony, at St. Denis, provides some surface agricultural
produce.

Sansterre acquired St. Denis by economic domination.

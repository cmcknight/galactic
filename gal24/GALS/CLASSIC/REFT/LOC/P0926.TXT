ESPERANZA
"Hope"

New Home built a second interstellar spaceship in 4810 and
launched it toward Esparanza.

Esperanza was settled in 4940.

Located on the extreme spinward edge of the Clusters, Esperanza
is ruled by a well-entrenched non-charismatic dictatorship which
enforces an oppressive political structure.  Its tentacles extend
to two vassal worlds:  Wellington and St. Hilaire.  Esperanzan
technology (at B) lags behind the other major worlds of the two
subsectors.

Two life-forms of potentially intelligent levels were present in
the Clusters when the colonists arrived.  One, the Batwings of
Esperanza, has subsequently been identified as Droyne; they were
eradicated within two hundred years of their arrival, a process
Esperanzan historians are strangely reluctant to discuss.

Jim:

I've downloaded your Galactic program and started to implement it
to keep track of my Traveller campaign.  What a wonderful system!
Thanks for making it available.

In return, I'd like to pass along some descriptive information to
add to your files.  My campaign is set in the Islands Clusters -
Old Islands and New Islands Subsectors (J and K), Reft Sector. 
It is based on material published in Supplement 5, Trillion
Credit Squadron, p. 40-47.  They properly belong to the
classic\reft\loc directory.

The descriptions themselves are all quotes from the supplement,
with three exceptions:  

(1) some minor rephrasing and repeating to have the quotes make
sense out of context, 

(2) one or two dates that are conjectural (the founding of
Esperanza, for example) but pretty conservatively extrapolated
from known data, and 

(3) the definitions for the world names.  These last I researched
myself, with help from the TML - any flaws, however, are my own.

The details in your file for these subsectors come from Trillion
Credit Squadron (CT), by way of The Regency Sourcebook (TNE). 
The UWPs are valid for 1106-1117 Imperial; the PBG extensions
come from The Regency Sourcebook, but directly contradict
material from the original (e.g., Zufluct is listed in TCS with
planetoid belts; in TRS and your data the value for "B" is 0).

I'll send along some more data as I get the opportunity; this was
simply what I already had on hand, plus some minor reformatting.

Cheers,

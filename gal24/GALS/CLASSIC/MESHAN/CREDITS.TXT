
Meshan Sector - Credits
-----------------------

This version of the Meshan Sector (circa 1120) was created by Mike Mikesh
with corrections by Clay Bush (27-Apr-94) and/or Leroy Guatney (14-Jun-94)
in order to convert all type VI stars to type V as per TNE. Don't know who
named the majority of the worlds.

Martin Rait (fspace@ihug.co.nz) confirmed on 28-Sep-94 that the data
matches DGP's dot map in Vilani & Vargr.

    Bruyrkna is  a hot chloric world  lying just off the  major spacelanes.
    All the settled areas are within enclosed arcologies, and are primarily
    there to  support the mineral extraction  industries, although there is
    also  a  large  percentage  that  come  because  of  a fascination with
    Bruyrkna's colourful swirling chlorine clouds. The world is a favourite
    case  study for  atmospheric  physicists  and politics  students alike.
    Bruyrkna has a  seemingly inverted government. The policies  are set by
    an  executive congress  of the  managing board  of the  Police, the  10
    wealthiest  Bruyrkna, the  inter-denominational Religious  Council, and
    the Land Owners'  Association. The congress meets twice  a year, and in
    between  meetings  delegates  law  making  to  the Congress Legislative
    Chairman who governs through the Bruyrknar civil service.

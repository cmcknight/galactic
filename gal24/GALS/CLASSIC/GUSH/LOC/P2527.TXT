    On  283-1110 a  50 million  ton  1  km diameter  asteroid crashed  into
    Etwefrewa. The months of warning had  enabled a large percentage of the
    planet's  700,000  population  to  be   moved  safely  to  Feirpend  or
    accommodated  in maximum  protection housing.  In the  end some  90,000
    people  died  in  the  collision.  The  violent  event stopped short of
    cracking Etwefrewa's small sphere open but has had a disasterous effect
    on the planet's atmosphere and  climate, knocking the planet 40 degrees
    off tilt. Since  1110 the IISS assisted by ZKK  have done their best to
    restabilise  the planet  and help  the population  to recover. Although
    Etwefrewa will take many decades to regain its former agricultural fame
    many have been surprised at just how good the 1115 vrine crop was.

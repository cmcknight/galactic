    Shiramuunir is one of the major  centres of Lancian culture. Settled by
    Vilani  and  Kukhunen  during  the  Ziru  Sirka its development closely
    followed that of  Kukhun, and the world adopted  the Lancian philosophy
    soon after recontact  in the early -100s. Like  many Lancian worlds the
    citizenry is happy to leave the  matter of government and law making to
    professionals whilst they get on with  the serious business of life. On
    Shiramuunir governmental power has been invested in a broadly empowered
    provost force. All  major decisions of policy direction  are decided by
    electronic  plebiscite   but  there  after   the  provost  manage   the
    implementation  of the  necessary laws,  and also  enforce them. Whilst
    such an approach  may seem strange to many it  is eminently sensible to
    many Lancians. Since it is the provosts' job to enforce laws, no matter
    what they are, why shouldn't they also  make and judge them. You do not
    end up  with unenforceable laws,  only sensible ones.  All was fine  on
    Shiramuunir until  1115 when a dramatic  scandal broke involving senior
    provost officers.  Shiramuunir's news channel, ORTF,  revealed that the
    provost had been using a waterborne  drug to subdue the populace of the
    city  of Iahen,  where the  local Ultra  group had  been the  source of
    constant  attention. This  was seen  as a  gross abuse  of power  and a
    referendum  only narrowly  voted not  to disband  the provost there and
    then. Shiramuunir continues  as before but the peoples'  faith in their
    government has been profoundly shaken.

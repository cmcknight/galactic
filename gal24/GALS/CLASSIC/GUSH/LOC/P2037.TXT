
    Highbury ( 2037 C424954-F D1 Hi In )                         circa 1116

    On a cold  moon erratically orbiting Thulm in  the industrial system of
    Highbury lies the Ancient site of  Oyrrayt. Discovered only in 823 by a
    mining prospector the site is located deep in a rock fissure, away from
    prying  eyes and  sensors. The  site consists  of three structures, one
    above the other:  a semi-circular platform,  flat side against the rock
    on top, a sphere below that, and an inverted pyramid at the bottom. The
    Unlargidgard Technical Institute  survey of 835 could find  no means of
    entry  or function,  but did  locate the  remains of  a second  similar
    complex  some  13km  further  along  the  fissure.  Further research at
    Oyrrayt  and amongst  the Droyne  of Highbury  has continued  but to no
    avail.

    Referee: The Oyrrayt  moon was a weapon, designed  to be driven against
    the Droyne colony on Highbury during the final war.

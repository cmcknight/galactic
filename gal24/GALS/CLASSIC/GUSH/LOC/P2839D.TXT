
    Uyess, Duchess Rehta ( 562 - 613 )

    The Civil War of the 600s touched lightly on Gushemege, and then really
    only on  the industrial heartland.  Karunimuur and the  heartland was a
    focus for dissent, whilst Lancia provided psy-op support to Arbellatra.
    The  main military  activity was  during 607-613  when Lagan  Subsector
    Duchess Rehta Uyess  decided time was ripe to exert  power. She had the
    backing  of Dashinshaii  and Shire  but Truax  refused to  join her. An
    on/off  war developed  over the  next few  years with naval engagements
    developing to Fleet  level. One well remembered incident  was the siege
    of Idull  Ra, which had sided  with Truax. Uyess' forces  laid siege on
    017-609,  isolating  the  world.  A  Truax  fleet  raised  the siege on
    318-610. Uyess was eventually defeated by a combination of economic and
    political  moves,  backed  by  Core  support  from  Arbellatra, and she
    comitted  suicide by  jumping her   private courier  into the  heart of
    Kadar's largest sun on 211-613.

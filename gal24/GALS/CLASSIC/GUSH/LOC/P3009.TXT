    Miz*rskua'mr  was settled  by S'mrii  from Mimu  in Dagudashaag  around
    -9000.  The S'mrii  have had  close  links  with the  Lancian for  many
    millenia since, and they fought  together against the Vilani during the
    border wars  of the third  millenium PI. Many  S'mrii worlds, including
    Miz*rskua'mr,  have  adopted  the  Lancian  philosophy.   The resultant
    cross-pollination  of ideas  and  technologies  has led  to significant
    advances in several fields, especially neurotechnology.

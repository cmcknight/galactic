
    Battle of Miha, 116

    The battle of Miha ( 3203 ) in  116 was one of the bloodiest battles of
    the  Vilani Pacification  Campaign.  A  joint Lancian/S'mrii  fleet was
    surprised during  replenishment by a  massive Vilani fleet  in a battle
    that  raged around  the system's  gas giants  and asteroid  belt for 60
    days.  In the  course of  this  Miha  itself was  subjected to  intense
    nuclear bombardment and the population of 300,000 was effectively wiped
    out. The  Vilani success opened the  way to the final  Vilani thrust on
    Kukhun,  and  drove  the  wedge  between  Kukhunen  Lancia  and S'mrii.
    Memorials to the  dead exist on Miha and in  free orbit around the sun,
    Tinisutta.


    Taeahtaho ( 2930 D887331-5 S Lo Ni )                         circa 1116

    Taeahtaho is typical  of one of Gushemege's Aslan  worlds. The world is
    ruled by the Ua-wairlew clan, and  Alsan make up 83% of the population.
    Of the remaining sentiency most are  humaniti, and some 90% are of clan
    status.  Taeahtaho  was  colonised  by  Aslan  during  the great Ihatei
    expansion  of the  first millenia  PI which  led to  most of  the Aslan
    colonies  in the  sector. However   Taeahtaho was  not as  successful a
    colony  as  its  neighbour  Hkeakewoirea',  and  most colonist deserted
    Taeahtaho  for the  better life  on Hkeakewoirea'.  The Taeahtaho Alsan
    have regular links  with their bretheren in the  Hierate, but like most
    Gushemege Aslan they have developed many of their own unique traits.

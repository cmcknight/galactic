    Pennelasse  orbits  a  close  binary,  the  larger  component  of which
    features  an   extraordinary  degree  of   chromospheric  and  starspot
    activity. The  IISS maintains a  network of solar  observatories in the
    system,  and  conducts  chromospheric  probe  research  here.  For  the
    population solar  weather warnings are  as of interest  as tropospheric
    weather  forecasts.  All  of   Pennelasse's  electronic  technology  is
    protected against  high ionisation levels,  and orbital facilities  are
    also heavily shielded. Visiting starship  crews are advised not to stay
    in their own craft but to check into one of the free shielded shelters.
    Jump departures and long inter-planetary trips should be avoided during
    high activity levels.

    Rashiidaa is a desert world inhabited  by the Azwhew people. The Azwhew
    of Rashiidaa are of Vilani descent  and settled the world around -5000.
    If  it  were  not  for  the  lack  of  water  Rashiidaa would be a very
    attractive  world. Its  low gravity  makes physical  work easy, and its
    dense atmosphere  means that there is  always plenty of oxygen  to draw
    on. Rashiidaa  has no native life,  perhaps because of a  high original
    oxygen content, and the Azwhew survived through harvesting transplanted
    succulents which grow  like inverted trees in the  sand, extracting all
    the  buried  moisture.  Over  time  the  Azwhew  have  adapted  to  the
    conditions so their bodies operate at a very low metabolic rate, taking
    maximum advantage of conditions, and  minimising the need for water and
    food. With  the coming of higher  technology most food is  now grown in
    vast greenhouses but many Azwhew  still follow the traditional ways and
    live a contemplative life amongst the dunes and rocky steppe travelling
    from oasis to  oasis. It is customary amongst the  Azwhew for the women
    to eat first and the men to  have what is left; this was essential when
    the most  demanding action required  of an Awhew  was child-bearing and
    rearing, and the more masculine activities  were less in demand than on
    most planets.  Although the race  has grown out  of this old  fashioned
    custom it does hangover in restaurants, were technically only women are
    served. The  Azwhew are a peaceful  but conservative race who  have not
    been  to  welcoming  of  the   recent  suggestions  that  Rashiidaa  be
    terraformed.

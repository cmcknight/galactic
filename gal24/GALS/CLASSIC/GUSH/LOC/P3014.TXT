    Vell is one of the most pleasant  worlds in the subsector, with a large
    proportion  of the  planet given  over to  organic livestock and arable
    farming.   Most   of   the   sector's   agrocombines   and   interested
    megacorporations have  permanent offices at  Rye, the world's  capital.
    Vell is  also home to  the Sadetha Agrobotany  Congress, a five  yearly
    event  that sees  agriculturalists from  around the  sector converge on
    Vell's  Interstellar  Convention  Centre.  Hot  topics  at the congress
    include  the  latest  in  bioneered  plants  and  high yield production
    methods for  non-agricultual worlds.

    Referee:  The  Sadetha  congress  is  also  a  battleground for the big
    agrocombines  and   baby  megas.  Industrial   espionage  is  high   on
    everybody's list  and there are  plenty of opportunities  for bona fide
    security specialists.

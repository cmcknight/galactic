    Fay  Freeworld is  unique in  Gushemege for  being a  world whose  sole
    purpose  is   trade.  Historically  Fay  grew   to  importance  through
    victualling  passing ships  and being   the only  J-1 link  between the
    worlds of the  Gushemege Main and those of the  heartland. Fay soon saw
    that its position was a double edged  sword, in times of peace it could
    make a fortune  from trade, but in times of  war it became of strategic
    importance.  In -5385  the first  Freeworld Declaration  was made  that
    prohibited armed ships of any type  from entering the system, but which
    allowed free passage  to any other craft of any  power. During the wars
    of  the Ziru  Sirka, the  Rule of  Man, the  Long Night  and the  Third
    Imperium Fay has remained a Freeworld, often being used for exchange of
    prisoners  of the  signing of  truces. During  the Civil  War the  IISS
    decided  to  "guarantee"  Fay's  status  by  basing an unarmed Squadron
    there, despite  the fact that the  conflict was light years  away. IISS
    claimed that they made the move  because population decline  on Fay was
    so great that the world could  no longer properly man its SDB squadron,
    and  so guarantee  its own  freedom. The  population of  Fay is  highly
    inbred and  off-worlders are very  rarely granted resident  status. The
    Fay families, or Burrkers, date  back millennia, but increasing genetic
    problems  have indeed  put the   whole of the population's  survival in
    doubt.

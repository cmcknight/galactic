
    Ellus ( 2406 A73A8CF-C Wa )

    The water  world of Ellus  has traditionally been  run by a  government
    formed  from  the  seamens'  union;  a  government that enjoyed immense
    popular  support. However  several years   of bad  harvest and  a major
    aquacultural  scandal  in  1112  shook  the  faith  of  the  Ellusians,
    especially those  in the expanding service  industries. In 1115 another
    bad  harvest and  mass redundancies  pushed the  more extereme elements
    over the  edge, and terrorists  blew up the  Hapap Processing Plant  on
    1115-218.  Thus  started  a  rebellion  that  has  continued at varying
    intensities  ever since.  The rebels  have gained  control of two large
    arcologies  and Llani  Down and  High starports.  The rebels  currently
    enjoy  a  reasonable  amount  of  off-world  support,  especially  from
    Shiramuunir,  and the  Imperial Navy  base at  Ssaott is  ensuring that
    XBoat traffic and inter-stellar trade is not disturbed by the dispute.

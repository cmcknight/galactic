    Choma is a desert world whose inhabitants are mostly nomadic bedouin of
    Vilani  descent. The  choma are   divided into  two social  groups, the
    Ruumaa who move around in groups of  5 or less, often solitary, and the
    Kisamda  who  move  in  large  caravans.  Violence  occasionally flares
    between  the  groups,  usually   involving  disputes  over  waterholes.
    Although all the choma use animal  transport they do not shun other TL6
    technology, making great use of imported solar panels. Choma is plagued
    by the storm rider insect swarms.  It's other notable fauna is the Myem
    Gleece (q.v. ).

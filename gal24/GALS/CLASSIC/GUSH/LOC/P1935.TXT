    Aisteaya is  one of Gushemege's  Aslan worlds, but  has several notable
    differences  from  the  rest.  For  a  start  the  world was settled by
    different clans,  the Tralyeaeawi and Aokhalte.  Secondly the two clans
    have  little to  do with  one another.  The Tralyeaeawi  live in  domed
    arcologies, where  large air conditioning systems  mitigate against the
    hot  ambient temperatures  of Aisteaya.  The Tralyeaeawi  have embraced
    modern technology and have an  active TL9 civilisation. By contrast the
    Aokhalte have adopted a bedouin existence  out in the hot deserts. They
    settled Aisteaya two centuries before the Tralyeaeawi arrived, and feel
    put out by the latter's takeover of the world. The two clans do have to
    interact for  trade, the Aisteaya  bringing in spices,  foodstuffs, and
    minerals  from  the  desert,  and  the  Traleaeawi  providing  the more
    advanced processing, medical, and off-world trading facilities.


    Kyla ( 2704 BA7A222-B N Lo Ni Wa )                           circa 1116

    The water world of Kyla is the home of Puulim Naval Base and the 2260th
    CruRon. Puulim  Down is on an  atoll in Kyla's equatorial  belt. Puulim
    Down is also  a centre for ocean refuelling  and triphibian trials. The
    whole population  of Kyla is  employed by the  IN.

    Referee: One of the major reserach projects at Puulim is on submersible
    SDB and  interceptor systems. But the  real secret is the  KHG facility
    200km away from Puulim.  KHG is the IN's centre for Autonomous Software
    Program ( ASP ) research.

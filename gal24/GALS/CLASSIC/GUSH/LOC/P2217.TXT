    Ashsha is a small planet with a very thin atmosphere. Despite having an
    exceptionally high oxygen content, some  60%, the atmosphere is tainted
    with a microbe that causes extreme  drowsiness and sleep. This has made
    the world an  ideal training ground for marine  combat, since the taint
    can be  used to imitate both  the dangers of vacuum  and of biochemical
    agents. Longer term residents have  developed a limited immunity to the
    microbe, but still find hard work almost impossible.

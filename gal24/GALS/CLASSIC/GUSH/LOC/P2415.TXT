    The water  world of Kikhi Zun  is best known for  the presence there of
    the Phileas  Barrier. The Phileas Barrier  was started in 797  and took
    120 years to  complete. The barrier encloses 10^13 sq. km. and provides
    the only large area of dry land  on the planet. The project was jointly
    funded by  the Imperial Navy and  by the local government.  The methane
    tint  in  the  sea  made  life  on  this  otherwise  terran prime world
    difficult.  The  reclaiming  of  a  large  area  of  land  enabled  the
    inhabitants  to get  away from  the irritant  mist that  surrounded the
    small  islands   that  they  previously  settled,   and  establish  new
    settlements based on conventional building and farming techniques.

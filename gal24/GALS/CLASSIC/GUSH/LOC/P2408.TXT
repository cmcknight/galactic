    Cirsel  is  a  popular  recreational   world  for  Lancians  and  other
    Gushemege. The  Anjell Imperial is  a stupendous 5  star hotel and  the
    holiday home of many of  Gushemege's most wealthy sentients. For others
    the Moiv  Roleworld is a  popular destination. Cirsel  has a very  thin
    atmosphere  of 0.34  standard and  so  most  of the  tourist sites  are
    enclosed. However the delicate atmosphere  allows the less energetic to
    gain  superb suntans  as they  lie  on  their grav-beds.  Cirsel has  a
    profusion of  tall and delicate plants  and it was perhaps  the magical
    effect of these that first brought tourists to the planet

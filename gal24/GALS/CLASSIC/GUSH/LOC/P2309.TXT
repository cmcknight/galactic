    Oroth remains  a radioactive wasteland  from the ravages  of the Vilani
    Pacification  Campaign.  In  1112  Duchess  Iapi  announced  a  plan to
    terraform the world,  and the spearhead team arrived  in 1114. They are
    now hard at  work using bio-agents to "scrub"  the atmosphere and soil.
    The terraforming process is expected to take about 50 years. Some areas
    are likely to remain forbidden  zones even if re-settlement is allowed.
    The B class starport is an orbital facility only.

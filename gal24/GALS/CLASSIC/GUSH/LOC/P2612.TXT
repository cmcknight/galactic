    Maru  has a  carbon/sulphur based  ecology and  is the  site of a major
    research  centre. The  aipess is  the most  well known  of the Maruvian
    life-forms. At 800 kg the aipess is  the same size as a terran buffalo.
    There though the similarity ends.  The aipess has a yellow transluscent
    skin  and 6  motor limbs.  Its fearsome  reputation is  due to  various
    factors: the herds of a dozen or so in which it travels, the three long
    frontal  horns, and  the long  snout  that  has been  known to  flatten
    xenobiologists  in   an  absent-minded  flick.   The  snout  with   its
    furrball-like head is used to sweep  the sulphur dust from the surface,
    so starting  the respiratory process.  Despite its fearsome  aspect the
    aipess is a herbivore, although that term can be difficult to interpret
    on Maru. Due to the slower metabolism many Maruvian creatures have long
    inactive phases when they revert to a "plant" form. Even the aipess can
    pass through such  a phase, brought on at will  or when food is scarce.
    In the  case of the aipess  it buries itself except  for its snout, and
    the snout catches  passing sulphur whilst the body  absorbs sulphur and
    other nutrients through osmosis. Maru  provides never ending sources of
    fascination for xenobiologists and much remains to be discovered.

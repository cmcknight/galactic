
    Gudak ( 3211 A45744-F Ag )

    Gudak's  representative  democracy  is  a  little  unusual in that only
    mothers are enfranchised.  For centuries Gudak has been  under the sway
    of  the  "New  Matriarchy",  part  sect,  part  political  party, which
    beleives that since mothers have a  unique investment in the future, it
    is only  they that can  be relied upon  to govern the  country. The New
    Matriarchy  spends  much  time  and  data  dwelling on the relationship
    between   mothers  and   daughters,  and   these  are   the  only   two
    classifications that matter on Gudak. Men are allotted the menial tasks
    of  manual  and  administrative  work  and  domestic  chores,  and seem
    generally  content with  their lot.  The New  Matriarchy has tried with
    varying degrees  of success to  export its ideas,  and they have  found
    vocal supporters on some other worlds in the sector. Travellers visting
    Gudak are advised  to ensure that they have a  mother in their party if
    they  are to  stand any  chance  of  making progress  with the  Gudaki.
    Failing  that they  will find  that the  Gudaki will instinctively deal
    with the women of child bearing age.

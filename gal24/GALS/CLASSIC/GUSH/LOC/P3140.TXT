    Ladi is characterised by its very  high law level. Unlike many high law
    worlds though the Ladians see such a  law level as the natural state of
    affairs, and believe overwhelmingly in priveleged security over general
    individual  liberty.  Every  private  and  public  space  on  Ladi  can
    potentially be viewed by security cameras or "secure-bots". In addition
    every  citizen has  a wrist  implant which  allows continual  location,
    health,  and voice  monitoring, and  all communications  are subject to
    analysis.  For the  visitor this   law and  order can  seem oppressive,
    especially since off-worlder's are subject to the same high code, being
    issued with  security bracelets on  arrival. The Ladians  maintain that
    such  measures  prevent  societies  from  degenerating  into  havens of
    sedition and lawlessness,  and allow citizens to go  safely about their
    own business. The Ladian need for  a cocooned environment also shows in
    its governmental system which is based on a heriditary bureaucracy. The
    bureaucracy is housed  in the Gallacci Arcology and  its members rarely
    leave the complex, relying on their security monitors to tell them what
    the people want and think.

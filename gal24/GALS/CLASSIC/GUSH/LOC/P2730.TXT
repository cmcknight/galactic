    The desert  world of Irkhun was  the site of a  major bioagent accident
    that had the drastic effect of inducing long term memory loss. This has
    had a catastrophic impact on the local population and technology level.
    Irkhuni now have a memory that  rapidly deteriorates after 48 hours and
    so  there  is  great  emphasis  on  making,  carrying, and referring to
    records.  The long  term acquisition  and development  of knowledge and
    skills, other  than natural functions, has  been made impossible unless
    there  is  total  and  continuous  dedication.  The  effect  on  social
    relationships has  been similarly devastating. The  accident occured in
    841  and  a  research  station  has  been  based  there ever since. The
    offending agent was declared scrubbed in 1032 but by then it had gained
    a genetic foothold.  Many travellers find gainful  employment on Irkhun
    as "memories"  for rich Irkhuni. The  planet is also a  good market for
    personal information systems.

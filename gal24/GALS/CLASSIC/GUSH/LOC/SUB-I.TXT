    Abstract: Summary of systems of the subsector and basic data.

    BALECH SUBSECTOR

    This subsector  (I of Gushemege) is  under the harsh rule  of Duke Rall
    Talenn who  has used his position  to grab further power,  line his own
    pockets (and those of his friends) and subjugate the people. He is only
    tolerated by  the central Gushemege authorities  as he is control  of a
    very strategically  valuable region. The  subsector fleets protect  the
    spinward flanks of Gushemege from  the Federation of Ilelish and Aslani
    Ihatei. Open criticism or action to curb the Duke's excesses may be the
    excuse  he needs  set up  an independent  state (thereby  depriving the
    sector of valuable resources) potentially hostile, or worse still, side
    with  Dulinor.  Both  paths  would  leave  the  centre of Gushemege and
    vulnerable to attack.

    The  vapethi are  minor non-human  sophonts native  to Inapiirn (0723).
    They are  pleiomorphic, having a  variety of shapes  to suit the  local
    climate/environment, the company they are present with, status; this is
    also altered by the individuals' emotional  state. The basic shape is a
    rounded cylinder  with usually a  quartet of tentacle-like  appendages.
    The 'skin' is also an important  indicator of mood where the darker the
    shade the more intense and serious the individual's feelings.

    Orren  Station  (0623)  was  once  a  Sylean  Scout  Service monitoring
    station,  which was  established to  survey Verge  and the  edge of the
    Great Rift. The outpost was attacked in  241 by some of the first aslan
    ihatei to  enter Gushemege. The aslan  moved on but not  before killing
    all  those at  the station  and stripping  the site  of everything that
    could be carried away.

    Mehrai  (Y944000-0)  is  ravaged  by  sandstorms  (with  winds reaching
    200kph) across  most of the surface  - several vessels are  believed to
    have been lost when attempting to enter the vicious atmosphere. In 1106
    an independently-owned  long liner (the  "Barok") on a  trading mission
    into Verge sector reported maneouvre  drive failure on going into orbit
    around Mehrai. The ship's orbit began  to decay and the captain ordered
    the passengers  and crew to abandon  the vessel in the  liner's launch.
    The captain stayed aboard as the  launch moved off to Hanrii (0125) the
    satellite of Mehrai. The ship was lost to all sensors as it entered the
    atmosphere. The poor facilities at the class E starport and the savaged
    nature of  the planet meant that  anything other than a  cursory search
    could be undertaken.

    Much of the equatorial zone of  Armec (0527) is covered in native flora
    in a combined jungle/swamp habitat.  It is believed to potentially hold
    vast reserves of  petrochemicals and other useful organics.  But as yet
    no company has yet come up  with the substantial investment required to
    undertake  the necessary  exploratory  work.  The class-A  starport was
    built in expectation  of a rush to the world  to plunder its riches but
    as yet this  influx has failed to materialised. It  is also rumoured to
    be a safe haven for pirates which prowl the Verge-Gushemege border.

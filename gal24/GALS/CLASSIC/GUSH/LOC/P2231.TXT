    Zanish is famed as the location  of the Marou Tower. The undersea Marou
    Tower is one of the engineering  marvels of the Sector. The tower rises
    from the  bottom of a  10,000m trench to  1000m above sea-level  and is
    home to 900,000  people. The tower was started in  943 and completed in
    1027. It was  designed by the renowned Lancian  architect Susma Pattnai
    and won her the Alvaar prize. The arcology specialises in high pressure
    chemical  and metallurgical  processes and  deep oceanography.  In 1074
    Zanish's inept bureaucratic government was overthrown by Kayno Namaa, a
    popular singer  and financier. Kayno's dictatorship  was benign, but in
    1093  he  was  succeeded  by  his  son,  who  had  none of his father's
    intelligence or skill. Miach Namaa  is paranoid about being overthrown,
    and so has done his best to tightly control the population and to limit
    offworld  contact. Zanish  now has  a  police  state, and  the Class  B
    starport  has been  wrecked by  Miach's Public  Safety Police  ( PSP ),
    resulting in  only Class E facilities  being available.

    Referee: Zanish  is a major  cause for concern  amongst Truax nobility,
    and intervention over the next few years is a distinct possibility.


    Stedeng ( 1727 E424620-9 Ni )                                circa 1116

    Stedeng  is  the  private  world  of  Count  Consetta Hatowski, a minor
    Dashinshaii noble. Hatowski retired with the rank of Brigadier from the
    Imperial Marines  in 1101 and  immediately turned the  family home into
    the largest  private military academy  in Gushemege. Hatowski  not only
    trains officers and  men for the Imperial and  colonial forces but also
    maintains  a divisional  sized mercenary  unit. As  mercenaries go  the
    "Ossin Ruh" are well trained, well equipped, and expensive. Katowski is
    always anxious to avoid contracts whch may bring him into conflict with
    Imperial forces, and often sends  units to Corridor for "live training"
    against the Vargr.

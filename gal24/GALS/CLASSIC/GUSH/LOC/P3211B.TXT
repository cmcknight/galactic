
    Colti, Aklass ( 745 - 804 )

    Aklass Colti was born on Shakhamash in 745. Colti proved to be a gifted
    psionic. Colti's  speciality was tele-hallucination, and  in 787 he was
    appointed to  the chair of Psycho-Suggestion  at the Shakhamash Psionic
    Institute. As the  tide turned against Psionics at the  end of the 700s
    Colti stood firm in the sciences' defence. In 804 Colti was gunned down
    in an open  street. The sympathetic reaction to his  death bought a few
    more years for  the Institute, but it was  eventually sacked and closed
    down in  815.

    Referee: Colti was  not assasinated. The whole event  was his most bold
    and successful  projection. Colti went  into hiding on  Gudak. Over the
    next  10  years  several  leading  psionics  from Shakhamash joined him
    there, and  the Gudak underground psionic  institute, trading under the
    name  of  Taaptiik  CreativeTechnologies,  has  been  in existence ever
    since.

    The Giiguuglum of  Seaport (q.v.) are an exotic  fungal minor race. The
    Giiguuglum are  near static creatures and  all communication and mating
    takes place through the exchange of spores. This has made inter-species
    communication  exceptionally  difficult.   The  Giiguuglum  have  large
    conformal visual and  olfactory sensors, but no sense  of taste, touch,
    or hearing.  Their prime sense  is a biochemical  one, obtained through
    physical  cell-links and  free floating  spores. They  have developed a
    biochemical rather than a  metallurgical technology, coaxing plant life
    to  create structures  and using  powerful pangenic  spores to  control
    other fungi. Seaport is devoid of  animal life as we understand it. The
    biological constructions and computers of  the Giiguuglum have been the
    cause of much interest amongst  research teams, but the difficulties of
    communication have  hampered their work.  The Giiguuglum were  at about
    TL8 when first contacted in 837, although some technologies were closer
    to  TL11. However  their  lack of  transportation, power,  or  military
    technology makes  the simple tech level  assessment useless. Their tech
    profile has changed little since  contact, and had been fairly constant
    for  a millenia  or so  before contact.  The latest  IISS assessment is
    CC-6E4DD-0000-00-E.  The  Giiguuglum  have  experimented  with Imperial
    transportation technology but have not been that taken by it. They have
    though  taken  three  heavily  modified  far  traders  in  exchange for
    biotechnology and these  craft are a unique sight in  the Sector as the
    Giiguuglum conduct their own surveys of "alien" life.

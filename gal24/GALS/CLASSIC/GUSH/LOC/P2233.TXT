    Khugika  is home  to a  medieval civilisation  that has  grown out of a
    pre-Long Night  Solomani colony. The  IISS has kept  a Red Zone  on the
    world to  protect its development  as its population  struggles to find
    its way. Wars between the states are common, but without gunpowder they
    are not a threat to the civilisation's survival.

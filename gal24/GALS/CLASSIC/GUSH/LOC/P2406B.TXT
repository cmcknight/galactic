
    Tujas, Kait ( b. 1073 )

    Kait  Tujas from  Uurkhi is  renowned throughout  Lancian space  as the
    foremost living  player of Osakoss,  the great game  of Lancia. Osakoss
    weaves complex patterns and strategies from the whole gamut of sentient
    experience. As  such it is  not suprising that  Tujas' opinion is  much
    sought  on  a  wide  range  of  affairs.  She  is  a close confident of
    Subsector  Duchess  Iapi.  Tujas  was  born  in  1073.  She  has little
    tolerance for people  who do not understand Osakoss.  Her current abode
    is on  the water world  of Ellus.

    Referee: Tujas is a keen but secret "social" artist and maintains links
    with a number of Hiver manipulators.

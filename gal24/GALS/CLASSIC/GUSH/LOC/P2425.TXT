    The Kieaasu  Va Research Facility  ( KVRF )  is a system  wide research
    station dedicated to the study of gas giant aerolife and related gentic
    engineering and terraforming  issues. Elt has a rich  variety of native
    aerolife,  and this  is kept  as a  quarantined area.  Podero is  a zoo
    composed of  imported and geneered  aerolifeforms. Temom is  the centre
    for  terrafoming   studies,  although  terraforming   here  relates  to
    improving fuel purity and making a living, biological chemical refining
    plant. The small gas giant Kusda is used for geneering and terraforming
    experiments, with several Elt  lifeforms having been introduced. Whilst
    KVRF  is  based  in  orbital  and  lunar  facilities  the  planet has a
    fragmented society of  various settler groups who are  engaged in small
    scale terraforming opertions with the assistance of KVRF. Kieaasu, with
    its  near  Sol-prime  star,  has   become  a  popular  destination  for
    break-away settlers and social refugees.

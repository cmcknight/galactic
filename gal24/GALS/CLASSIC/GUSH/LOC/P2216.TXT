
    Seaport ( 2216 C5A5655-C Ni Fl )

    Seaport is  the home of  the exotic Giiguuglum  minor race (q.v.).  The
    Giiguuglum are  exceptionally alien, being closer  to the fungal rather
    than the animal kingdom. Seaport itself has an ammonia atmosphere which
    gives the world a glorious blue-green  colour, from which it gained its
    name.  The   world  has  no   conventional  animal  life,   with  fungi
    representing the highest level of development and occupying the tops of
    the food chains.

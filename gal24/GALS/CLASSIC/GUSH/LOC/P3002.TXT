    The  world of  Fuqui is  an astrographic  novelty since  it is the only
    world in the system. Imkhak, the  red sub-dwarf star, stands watch over
    a near  empty solar  system.  Apart from Fuqui  there are  a few  dozen
    sub-kilometre   sized   asteroids   and   comets   but   nothing  else.
    Astrographers have  been tempted to  link Imkhak's strange  system with
    the Ancients and  the small Chriper population, but  meteor analysis of
    Fuqui's surface  has suggested that  the system was  never particularly
    rich  in rocky  bodies. Leading  theories include  a captured planet, a
    silicon poor accretion  disk, and an Ancient enigma.

    Referee: Fuqui is in fact a  natural phenonema due to an unusually poor
    concentration  of silica  and metals   in the  original gas  cloud. The
    system intrigued Grandfather who planted a primitive Droyne grouping on
    the  world to  see how  they coped  with the  silent sky.  To even  his
    amazement  the  Droyne  regressed  over  generations,  losing drive and
    imagination, and eventually reverted to a chirper from.

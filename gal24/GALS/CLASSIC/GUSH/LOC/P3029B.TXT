
    Branu, Saha ( b. 1038 )

    Saha Branu was  born in 1038 on the  world of Khankaar ( 2625,  q.v. ).
    She  soon tired  of what  that unpredictable  system had  to offer  and
    stowed  away on  a Sesh-Ifaen  freighter. Over  the next  few years she
    worked  her way  across the  subsector, eventually  arriving on Phaln (
    3029 ). A  most resourceful and ruthless women she  soon carved a niche
    for herself as  PA to Anastasia Yst, the undisputed  queen of the Phaln
    underworld. In  1077 Yst was  killed in a  sport speeder accident,  and
    Branu rapidly moved  to consolidate her hold on  Yst's empire, which is
    known to the  street as the Regh Ha. Since  then Branu's tentacles have
    spread to most  of the Industrial worlds of  Gushemege's heartland. The
    Regh Ha has become a major  cause of concern to Sector law enforcement,
    and  is believed  to be  behind several  coup attempts  on some  of the
    higher law  level worlds of  Shire. Referee: It  is not commonly  known
    that Yst  and Branu were  lovers, and that  Branu was the  architect of
    Yst's death, part  greed and part lover's revenge. The  Regh Ha and the
    lawless system of Suysu ( 3023,  q.v.) are constantly at odds and there
    have  been several  outbreaks of  inter-gang warfare  over the last few
    decades.

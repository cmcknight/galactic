
    Deewaa ( 2223 X230320-5 Lo Ni Po De R )                      circa 1116

    Deewaa is a sombre and mournful  world, which is bearing witness to the
    extinction  of the  Jirtoygh minor  race. The  Jirtoygh are believed to
    have contracted  a fatal disease  from the crew  of a safari  ship that
    broke the  world's quarantine and  red zone classification  in 487. Sir
    Beckon Verbat, a  local knight with an estate on  Droun was a hunter of
    some renown and was seeking new  trophies for his hunting lodge. He had
    no  thought for  the effect  he could  have on  the Deewaa ecology, and
    Emporer Cleon  IV had him banished  even before the full  extent of the
    catastrophe  was  known.  Many  efforts  have  been  made  to save  the
    Jirtoygh  but  so  far  to  no  avail.  They  now number only some 6400
    sentients.


    Wolstene ( 2414 C000675-C S Na Ni As )                       circa 1116

    The  vacuum world  of Wolstene  is an  asteroid in  captured orbit of a
    hothouse planet. The  9 million population has been  attracted over the
    centuries   by  Wolstene's   high  mineral   content.  The  traditional
    prospectors' rivalry has shown through in the balkanised arrangement of
    the  world, with  various families'  claims making  up the "countries".
    Each of  the 1000 or so  family clans lives in  a separate domed crater
    base, and the asteroid's surface is  covered by mine workings and claim
    beacons. Claim wars occur, but not as often as some might expect.

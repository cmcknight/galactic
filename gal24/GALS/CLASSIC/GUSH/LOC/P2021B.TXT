    The  gunby is  a major  source of  meat protien  in Gushemege and other
    sectors on this trailing side of the  Great Rift. A native of Vuyha the
    gunby was first  recognised as a food source by  the Vilani. Since then
    the gunby has been geneered to survive on a wide variety of worlds. The
    gunby itself is  a grazing herbivore of 80-140kg  average mass. Gunbies
    are trifoil hooved and have two  pairs of downward pointing sabre teeth
    which they used  to break up the hard and  often frozen ground of their
    native steppe. The gunby has 4 legs  but no tail. It resembles a terran
    boar,  but  has  a  woolier  coat  (  which  is often used in Gushemege
    clothing ). It originally lived in herds of 10 - 20 on the open steppes
    of Vuyha. The Bonotil Cof restaurant on Usdiki serves the best Gunby in
    the Imperium. Leeng's  "Saddle of Gunby Au Cruyess" is  one of the most
    superb dishes known to humaniti.

    The  rich agricultural  world of  Tudjman has  been in  the throws of a
    rebellion since 1115. The agribusinesses have been increasingly at odds
    with the powerful Agriculture Bureau over crop taxes, and a tax hike in
    1115  to  pay  for  a  new  SDB  squadron  was  the  final  straw.  The
    agribusinesess attacked the capital, and the struggle has now developed
    into one between the rural and urban communities.

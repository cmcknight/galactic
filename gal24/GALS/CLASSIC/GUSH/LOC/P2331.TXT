    The water world of Aying is undergoing drastic geothermic upheaval that
    has raised the ambient water temperature  from 288K to 308K since 1105.
    IISS has  a survey team  on the planet  and evacuation plans  have been
    made  since  the  temperature  rise  is  killing  of  most of the local
    lifeforms.

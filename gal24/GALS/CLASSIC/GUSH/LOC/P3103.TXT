    Like Ka Maz, Yta Akat is a Red Zone desert world. But whereas Ka Maz is
    a conventional  desert  Yta  Akat  is  waterless  due  to its corrosive
    atmosphere. The Red Zone classification is  because Yta Akat is home to
    one of the  few minor races to have evolved  in such an atmosphere. The
    Lumu are a vaguely crustacean  race and bear many parallel evolutionary
    characteristics with the Eshaar Ashah of Far Frontiers. Like the Eshaar
    Ashah  the Lumu  have a  silicon-based physiology  and a chemosynthetic
    metabolism. The Lumu have a domed  carpace, a pair of specialised front
    manipulators, and  4 pairs of legs.  IISS interdiction and surveillance
    satellites keep watch on the development of the Lumu.

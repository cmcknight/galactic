
    Gangal'Waer

    Gangal'Waer is a  religion having its high shrine on  Moy ( 2735 ). The
    influential religion is monotheistic and characterised by the fact that
    followers  precede all  major decisions  with a  20 day  sojourn in the
    wilderness,  and all  monumentous decisions  with a  visit to  the Waer
    shrine on  Moy. Even business transactions  are likely to fall  foul of
    this communion with god, with  followers disappearing for 20 minutes or
    20 hours  to seek god's  decision on a  deal. The religion  has some 10
    billion followers across rimward  Gushemege. Gangal'Waer are intolerant
    of non-human races,  and are also in frequent  dispute with the Virasin
    of Ilelish and Gushemege's Ilelish Rim.


    Imarshas ( 2627 C9C69EE-9 S Hi Fl )                          circa 1116

    Imarshas is a hell-hole of a  planet whose settlers have been attracted
    by  its  mineral  rich  hot  seas.  The  oceans  are  full of extensive
    suspensions of sulphur and chlorine  compunds and these are "harvested"
    by  giant factory  ships. Imarshas  is ruled  by Tostadi  Ra, the  high
    priestess of a break-away sect of the Gangal'Waer ( q.v. ). The Ra'Waer
    beleive that  god takes a more  constant interest in their  work and so
    devotion is performed  "1 in 20", normally 1 hour  in every 20, but for
    priests and  extreme devotees 1  minute in every  20 as well.  The high
    preist  is a  semi-heriditary appointment,  circulating between  the 20
    leading families. Tostadi Ra has been a benign ruler, and has served to
    counteract some of the worst excesses of her predecessor.


    Llaet ( 3107 D587100-A S Lo Ni )

    The scout base on Llaet was established in 837 to study the Oniinn. The
    Oniinn  are one  of the  largest creatures  ever discovered, being many
    kilometres  across.  They  resemble  giant  turtles,  floating  in  the
    shallows of Llaet's  seas. For many centuries the  Oniinn were not even
    recognised as  animals. Llaet is  now the focus  of much xenobiological
    research into macrofauna.

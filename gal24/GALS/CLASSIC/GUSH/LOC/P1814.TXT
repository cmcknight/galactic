    A thriving agriproducts exporter Apay Maru suffered from a major global
    war between its  4 governments from 1105 to 1111.  The war went nuclear
    late in  1110 at which  point the subsector  government stepped in  and
    enforced a 'Pax Imperia'. IISS has extended its base to assist with the
    recovery program, and a S'mrii ZKK  team arrived on the planet in 1114.
    A prime reason for  the interest in the recovery  of pre-war conditions
    on  Apay Maru  is the  demand  for  ground plants  and products  on the
    neighbouring water worlds.

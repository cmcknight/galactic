
    Masa ( 2513 B221AAA-F S Hi Na In Po )                        circa 1116

    Masa was  the orginal Vilani  capital of Gushemege,  declared in -7892.
    From here the Vilani launched  their Consolidation Wars and established
    the Ziru Sirka  in Gushemege. During the Nth  Interstellar War Masa was
    devastated  by  nuclear  bombardment,  and  after  the war the Solomani
    transferred the capital to Kamurinmur (  2224) in -2204. Masa has never
    really recovered from  the bombardment and loss of  status. Although it
    maintains  a high  population and  is an  industrial exporter  there is
    little zest for life and this small arid world is a poor and depressing
    place.

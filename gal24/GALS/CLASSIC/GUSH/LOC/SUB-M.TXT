    VIPACH SUBSECTOR

    No other region of Gushemege has  such a mixture of complex history and
    intractible mystery. Within the boundaries  of Vipach there is believed
    to be the homeworld of the Loeskalth - the aggressive and warlike human
    race  wiped-out  by  the  vilani  in  the  Consolidation Wars. With the
    conquest and eradication of the Loeaskalth, the record of their origin,
    their  identity  and  culture  have  been  lost.  Only fragments of the
    language remain. The best educated  guess as to the Loeskalth homeworld
    is Abaelou (0233), a medium-sized planet with a readioactive taint. The
    interesting  feature of  the taint  is that  the radioactive  signature
    matches that of  vilani nuclear weapons of the  Consolidation Wars era.
    The Abaelou  hypothesis is backed-up  by two other  pieces of evidence;
    the  discovery  of  ruined  human-styled  cities  by  the  IISS and the
    discovery  of a  huge asteroid  ship  in  the Aapu  system (0132).  The
    asteroid ship indicates an origin in the Abaelou system.

    The prescence of a large number of  scout bases and the Way station (at
    Wilson,  0740)  is  due  to  the  location  of  Vipach at the corner of
    Gushemege,  Reft, Ilelish  and Verge  sectors. They  service the  large
    volume of scout traffic moving between the Core and the Great Rift. The
    Vipach  scout bases  are also   involved in  the continuing  search for
    the positive identification of the Loeskalth homeworld.

    The world  of Vipach (0632) was  once the capital of  the subsector and
    still  today the  subsector name  identifies that  link. The  world was
    eclipsed  in importance  by Dikaash  in the  early years  of the  Third
    Imperium when Glirse LIC located some of the most valuable platinum and
    gold deposits in the subsector. Dikaash is still a centre of excellence
    in the production of  microelectronics, non-organic catalysts and space
    life-support systems.

    The subsector  is the most heavily  populated in Gushemege highlighting
    its  long  history  of  colonisation  (almost  from  the  first  vilani
    explorations  into the  sector) -  the total  population approaches 106
    billion.  The  majority  of  the  inhabitants  are  human but there are
    significant numbers of Ael Yael and Vapethi. The human population are a
    mix of  vilani, solomani, tapazmal, loeskalth  and others. The greatest
    concentration of life is on Sagal  (0337) and has been interdicted by a
    joint IISS-Imperial Navy commission  (in 1103) following the desruction
    of  the starport.  This was  a consequence  of an  uprising of  Ilelish
    militants. Although small, the trouble has been continuous since with a
    increase in intensity of the raids by the pro-Dulinor faction after the
    onset of the Rebellion. As of 1121 the world is nominally independent.

    Jaeyelya is the home of the Ael Yael and is reserved for the habitation
    of the  Ael Yael only  (bar residents of  the surface IISS  station and
    diplomats).  The world  does see  plenty of  other races either through
    trade or tourism.

    The importance of Homage as the bread-basket of Vipach is underlined by
    the  presence  of  the  naval  base.  Numerous  conflicts in orbit have
    focussed on the  control of the system, as the  holder of the world can
    starve the  surrounding region into  submission. Since the  outbreak of
    the 'Rebellion' in  late-1116, the world has changed  hands three times
    between  pro-Lucan,   pro-Dulinor  and  lately,   pro-Strephon  forces.
    Currently the world is held by Strephon.

    Ounash is  claimed by a small  number of tribes descended  from asiatic
    nomads of the central region Asian continent of Terra. The peoples have
    rejected  technology living  much as  there ancestors  did 10,000 years
    ago.  Numerous  attempts  by  industrial  combines  to extract valuable
    organic resources locked under the dry  crust have been rebuffed by the
    'Council  of the  15 Tribes'.  Survey teams  which have  landed without
    permission by the council have been shown little mercy when caught.

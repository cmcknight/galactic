    The Aplaudira Plains  on sandswept Teghde are the home  of the 4 yearly
    Aplaudira  Sandyacht champonships.  Whilst sandyachting  takes place on
    many worlds  of the sector it is to Teghde and Aplaudira  that devotees
    make their  olympian pilgrimage. The  10 days of  the Championships are
    also a  popular social occasion  for the Gushemege  nobility and Sector
    Duke Kirshaam  Miikadgaa is a  regular visitor to  the event. When  the
    championships are not  running the plains are still  host to a sizeable
    sandyachting  fraternity who  claim  that  Aplaudira's sands  are "well
    crucial" and without equal in the Sector.


    Khankaar ( 2625 E633323-A Lo Ni Po )                         circa 1116

    At the heart  of the Khankaar is Anheuser, a  highly unstable M3V star.
    This red sub-dwarf exhibits  constant and unpredictable oscillations of
    it  heliosphere. In  the words   of Professor  Puccino of  the Khankaar
    Observatory Anheuser  "wobbles like jello  in zero-G". Inevitably  this
    has disasterous consequences for Khankaar itself which suffers terrible
    upsets to it tropospheric and  magnetospheric weather. Most building as
    semi buried, and for the last  100 years all new developments have been
    underground below a suitable radiation shielding depth of soil.

    Imperial Research Station  Pi is located in the  Mezregh system. Little
    is  known about  the research  conducted there.  As with other Imperial
    Stations security is very tight but  observers have noted two things of
    interest. Firstly  there appear to be  no testing or danger  areas, and
    accommodation is close to the labs, suggesting that the research is not
    in anyway dangerous,  which would rule out weapon  or biotech research.
    Secondly the Research  Station is a major buyer  of super-computers and
    is  rumoured to  have the  most concentrated  computing resource in the
    Imperium. This  has led some observers  to beleive that the  Station is
    involved  with  cryptographic  or  psychohistorical  research.

    Referee:  Research  Station  Pi  is  not  engaged  in  cryptography  or
    psychohistory, but does indeed have very large computing resources. The
    best  that is  known about  the research  is that  it concerns  the top
    secret  "Project Ptolmey".  Historical research  indicates that Ptolmey
    was a legendary  librarian in early Terran history,  which has led some
    to  believe  that  RSPi  is  the  site  of  the Universal Imperium Data
    Project, or a back up site for Reference.

    Abstract: Basic system information on Rure subsector (Gushemege F)



    RURE SUBSECTOR

    This subsector holds the sector capital  Usdiki (1015) and was moved to
    its  present site  following an  abortive rebellion  against Paulo I in
    760.  Usdiki  also  holds  the  centre  (not  astrographically)  of the
    Rurevayn sub-culture although not officially recognised as being within
    the Rurevayn boundaries (and  usually associated with the Archipelago).
    The  original  name  of  Usdiki  was  Rure,  hence  the subsector name.
    Following a popular uprising in 421  (riding on the back of the Ilelish
    Revolt  in  Truax  and  Laeth  in  420)  the  name  was changed and the
    administrative  capital switched  to Munnarn  (1013) in  an attempt  to
    dilute  the Rurevaynese  will. This  earlier short-lived  rebellion had
    followed several previous attempts at  gaining independence for a large
    cluster  of   solomani-colonised  worlds  bordering  F,   G,  J  and  K
    subsectors. Usdiki  is the home  of the subsector  Duke as well  as the
    Vacational fief of the Emperor Strephon.

    The  population  of  Munnarn  is  almost  exclusively composed of civil
    servants  and   naval  personnel  -  the   naval  base  was  originally
    established   to   enforce   Imperial   rule   at   the   time  of  the
    pro-independence  uprisings in  Rure. The  current naval  presence (the
    8184th  cruiser  squadron  of  the  231st  Penetration  Fleet)  is  now
    concerned  with  dissauding  Ilelish  encroachments  into  the  core of
    Gushemege as  well as forestalling any  further unilateral declarations
    of independence by the Rurevaynese worlds.

    In  recent times,  the systems  of Rurevayn  and of  Rure subsector  in
    particular have  taken a leading  role in the  development of cyberware
    and the biotech  industries. Much of the original  base technology came
    from  Lancia, which  has had  close economic  and industrial  ties with
    Rurevayn. Unfortunately the subsector government has failed to halt the
    growth  of an  extensive black  market in  cyberware systems. There has
    been an alarming spread of this sensitive and controversial technology.

    Divkar  (1518)  is  the  home   of  the  Traypih,  a  semi-intelligent,
    squid-like race of amphibians. They are  found in the shallow and warm,
    lagoon-like equatorial seas of the world. The Traypih are currently the
    subject of an extensive survey by a resident scout team.

    The system  of Lanaas (1414)  has seen recent  conflict associated with
    the Rebellion.  Remnants of an  Ilelish squadron apparently  mis-jumped
    into the system.  Elements of the local defense  fleets intercepted the
    squadron,  destroying  one  vessel  and  capturing  another  before the
    Ilelish ships could refuel, regroup  and jump out-system. Their fate is
    unknown.

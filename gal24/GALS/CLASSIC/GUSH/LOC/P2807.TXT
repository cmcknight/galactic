    The desert  world of  Ka Maz carries  Red  Zone status due  to the long
    lasting  effects   of  a  water  bonding   agent  released  during  the
    Pacification Campaign.  The  agent, known  as Khiizud,  turned all  the
    water on  the planet into crystals.  The agent even affected  the water
    that was in  the mucus, sap and other fluids  of the planet's flora and
    fauna, and  rapidly killed off  most life on  Ka Maz. The  agent is now
    largely  inactive due  to the lack of  non-crystallised water.  The few
    remaining inhabitants of the  planet survive in underground settlements
    and  travel  to  the  surface  in  stillsuits.  The  Red Zone status is
    maintained to prevent any spreading of the agent.

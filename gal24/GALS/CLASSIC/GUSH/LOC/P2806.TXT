    On  the water  world of  Sahee Lancian  aquaculture is  at its  finest.
    Surface and underwater habitats are a miracle of modern stylish design.
    The world-ocean also permeates the thinking of the Sahee, whose society
    is more uniform and flowing than on many other Lancian worlds. Sahee is
    also home to the largest colony of Scanian Aquans in the sector.

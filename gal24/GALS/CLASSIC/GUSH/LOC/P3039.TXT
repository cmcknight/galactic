
    Uskent ( 3039 C55A002-C Lo Ni Wa )                           circa 1116

    Uskent  is an  Imperial Marine  Reserve, with  Class C  port facilities
    available in orbit, and only landing pads dirtside. Uskent is a popular
    tourist  and   scientific  destination,  although   tourist  access  is
    carefully  controlled. Amongst  the many  fascinating indigenous marine
    creatures  is the  Namiir. The  Namiir is  an empathic  carnivore which
    lurkes around  the saragossa seas of  Uskent, lying still under  a thin
    layer  of  sand.  When  prey  approaches  it  sends out psionic empathy
    signals which pull  the prey towards it out  of intense curiosity. Many
    creatures literally  swim straight into  its waiting mouth.  The Namiir
    has a  similar effect on humans,  and most visitors to  the planet wear
    psi-helms when swimming.

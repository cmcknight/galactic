    The Tiirmmay bird is a native of Elk, a prominent agricultural world in
    the subsector, but can now be found on several worlds in Gushemege. The
    Tiirmmay bird evolved deep in Elk's  jungles, where survival was a very
    serious business. The  Tiirmmay is about the size  of a terran starling
    or vilani  uggiir, and is  black with orange  beak, claws, wing-stripes
    and chest.  The Tiirmmay's distinguishing characteristic  though is the
    fact that  it is deadly poisonous.  The poison permeates every  cell in
    the  Tiirmmay's  body,  making  any  scratch,  nip or touch potentially
    fatal.  The   poison  is  a  homo-vertrayka   toxin,  a  very  powerful
    neuro-toxin. A  serum is known and  is available for Cr50  on any world
    where the  Tiirmmay is found.  Without administration of  the serum the
    effects can range from numbness to death, depending on the constitution
    of the person and the amount of poison that has been transferred.

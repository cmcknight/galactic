
    Kukhun ( 3105 B658997-E A Hi Cp )

    Kukhun is  the home of the  Lancian culture. The planet  was originally
    seeded by  the Ancients with human  stock about 300,000 years  ago. The
    Kukhunen had  a tempestuous relationship  with the Vilani,  and found a
    common ally in the S'mrii. As Kukhun slipped into the Long Night it was
    faced with the twin threats of a bloody civil war and a new ice age. It
    was out of this perilous situation  that the Lancian Movement arose and
    managed to bring about peace and start planning for survival in the new
    ice age.

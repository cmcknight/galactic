    In the  depths of the Tingan  jungle on Toyusk  lies a 250km labyrinth,
    built of now greatly decayed stonewalls  and covered by a 2m deep layer
    of slate and soil. Discovered before  the Long Night by Vilani settlers
    the Labyrinth  has proved a constant  enigma. There is no  trace of any
    past civilisation  on the planet,  and the most  advanced lifeforms are
    primtive amphibians. Toyusk has attracted  the attention of many survey
    teams since it is a near  Terran prime planet. However all surveys have
    been  abandoned  due  to  the  acute  hallucinations  suffered  by  the
    visitors.  The  wearing  of  filtration  masks  brings  the effect to a
    tolerable  level, but  it is  still sufficient  to prevent conventional
    settlement.  Toyusk does  provide a  home for  a few  small colonies of
    drug, net and wirehead addicts, who  find that on Toyusk they can enjoy
    unparalleled consensic hallucinations for free. Needless to say most of
    these people are now certifiably mad.  IISS keeps a watch on the planet
    and provides help, advice and security to visiting science teams. There
    is a possibility that  the world may be posted as an  Amber Zone in the
    near  future.

    Referee:  The   hallucinations  are  psionic,   although  a  wind-borne
    micro-organism acts as an "amplifier". This fact is known to IISS and a
    number of  psi/neurotech companies, and  IISS is trying  to prevent any
    exploitation. Raising the  status to Amber Zone would  be a first step,
    and  IISS  is  willing  to  go  to  Red  if necessary. The labyrinth is
    beleived  by most  to be  the source  of the  disturbances, but by what
    mechanism people are unwilling to say.

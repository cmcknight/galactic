    Mulanje has  a population of  74% Chirper, out  of a 10,000  total. The
    population  is  run  as  a  collective  with  a  joint humaniti/chirper
    managing committee. The main actvities revolve around chirper foraging.
    The  society is  of interest   for the  high level  of humaniti/chirper
    integration, many humans  coming here to find a  more "fundamental" way
    of life.  Whilst a few  Droyne can  be  seen, the world  has yielded no
    relics of the Ancients. The system  is notable in having four large gas
    giants   each  with   about  a   dozen  satellites.   There  are   many
    xeno-archaeologists  convinced that  somewhere  out  there there  is an
    Ancient site waiting  to be discovered.

    Referee: There  is; hidden half  way up and  behind a 20km  ice-wall on
    Imkir, the fourth moon of the  third gas giant, Naan. The site contains
    a Droyne monitoring station which was abandoned early in the Final War.

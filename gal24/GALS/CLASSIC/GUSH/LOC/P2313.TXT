    Ed  is   home  to  the   Sector's  annual  Miguel   Chalice  Grav  Ball
    championships. The top two teams from  each of 13 subsector leagues and
    the Archipelago league compete. For the fortnight of the competition Ed
    is awash with  visitors and hotel and berth space  needs to be almost a
    year in  advance. The chalice  competition runs from  170 to 183  every
    year. The Count  of Ed is a colourful figure  in the Gushemege nobility
    with unbounded ambition. He has  often made speeches placing himself as
    an alternate subsector  Duke, and has even fancied  himself as a sector
    Duke. The Count of Ed does  maintain quite a sizeable private army, and
    often  deploys   his  ostensibly  colonial  and   system  Squadrons  to
    neighbouring systems.


    Uakchott Pirates

    The Uakchott are a pirate  band operating throughout the subsector. The
    Uakchott  take   their  name  from   the  mythical  Loeskalth   god  of
    destruction. The band  is a relatively small one  but is well organised
    and has demonstrated a high level  of technical competence. The band is
    beleived to  be able to  field about half  a dozen craft,  ranging from
    free traders, through a modified Vargr Corsair and a Frontier Transport
    to  at least  one Gazelle  close escort.  The band  favours sutblety to
    force,  and this  alone sets  it apart  from other  pirate bands in the
    Sector.  Most of  the band's  craft  are  fitted with  a wide  range of
    electronic equipment, and jamming and deception are a signature feature
    of Uakchott operations.

    Referee: The Uakchott base is in the outermost asteroid belt of Xanten.
    It is  located in one  of the many  deep caverns on  the 400km diameter
    asteroid known to the pirates as  Hillabay. The current leader ( 1116 )
    is the 43 year old Jacquard Satin.

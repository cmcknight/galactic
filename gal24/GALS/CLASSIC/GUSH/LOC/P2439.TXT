
    Susadi ( 2439 A8C1977-F Hi Fl )                              circa 1116

    Susadi  has  an  insiduous  atmosphere  with  a  major  hydrogen boride
    component. In the cold reaches of  Susadi's orbit the majority of HB on
    the planet is  in the form of HB  ice. This ice is reckoned  by many to
    offer  the best  surface for  ski sports  in Gushemege.  Every 4  years
    Gushemege  sports-sentients  brave  Susadi's  atmosphere  to  try their
    skills on the infra-black runs of  Coincidence, the major resort on the
    planet. Despite  high degrees of personal  protection deaths are common
    on Coincidence's slopes,  and Susadi has gained a  reputation as one of
    the great "dares" of Gushemege's younger, and lesser, nobility.

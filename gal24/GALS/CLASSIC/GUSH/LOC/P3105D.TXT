    In the  mythology of the  Kukhunen Viinntaala was  a goddess who  would
    descend to Kukhun  in ursine form. Legend has it  that she would wander
    the woods  and tundra wastes to  see how the Kukhunen  were progressing
    and  to  check  that  they  were  keeping  the  Paatissa laws. Faithful
    Paatissa knew that the bear that  stalked their land was Viinntaala and
    left her alone. But those who had  lost their faith feared the bear and
    would hide  their children from it  and then attack it.  The bear would
    kill them  for their unfaithfulness.  But Viinntaala would  be sorrowed
    that they had lost  their way and that she had had  to kill them and so
    she would  turn her ursine  self to  stone  and return her  soul to the
    heavens. These large lonely rocks which Viinntaala left became sites of
    worship for the  Paatissa, and often villages would  be built close by,
    the rocks serving  as a reminder that the Paatissa  laws should be kept
    and that Viinntaala may one day visit  and put their faith to the test.
    Needless to say contemporary geologist claim that the rocks are nothing
    but simple erratics left behind by the last ice age on Kukhun.

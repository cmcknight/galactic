
    LOXI Terrorist Group

    LOXI is a terrorist group active throughout Shire which is dedicated to
    the over-throw of feudal rule in the Imperium. The group has links with
    other republican  groups in Vland  Domain. Their most  infamous actions
    have been the assassination of Countess  Tahini in 1113 and the bombing
    of the  Monjui Palace on  Moytra in 1115.  The group is  believed to be
    based somewhere  in Shire.

    Referee: LOXI are in fact based on Moytra itself.

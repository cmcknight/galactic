    The  Vesu is  a native  of Howarth  in Dashinshaii  Subsector. Vesu are
    small ( 1kg  ) gliders that evolved in the  few rainforests and jungles
    of their homeworld. Vesu are able  to soar in the jungles many thermals
    for hours at a time, their small size enabling them to avoid collisions
    in the dense supergrowth. A filter by nature the Vesu has a large front
    "mouth" which sweeps any particles in its path into its gut. Vesu offer
    little real threat  to sentients, although they will  usually attempt a
    "sweep" on the food source and  their tough frontal horn has been known
    to penetrate  mesh. Vesu are usually  found in small flocks  of 6 to 20
    creatures, mostly  in the upper reaches  of the forest, just  below the
    canopy. Vesu eggs are easily mistaken  for blue hued amber like jewels,
    and  it  was  this  that  led  to  their  spreading  across much of the
    Gushemege heartland.  Vesu eggs are  still used for  decoration but are
    now first sterilised with UV light. There is also a keen market in fake
    Vesu eggs.

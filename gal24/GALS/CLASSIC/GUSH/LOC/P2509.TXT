    Jonsova  is a  fine example  of  a  world where  local conditions  have
    affected  Lancian  art  and  way  of  life.  Jonosva's  methane/ammonia
    hydrosphere and its towering ice mountains have inspired a unique style
    in  Lancian architecture,  and some  fine visual  art. Towering crystal
    stuctures  are the order of  the  day,  contrasted to  the dark  of the
    insiduous ocean flows.

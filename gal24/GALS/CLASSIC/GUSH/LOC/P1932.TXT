    Hopkins' system  is an astronomers'  enigma. Every body  in the system,
    and there are more than 20,  orbits in an irregular  manner. Most orbit
    out of the solar plane, and many  swing inside and beyond the orbits of
    their neighbours. There are  several stunningly close conjunctions, and
    these are a  major tourist attraction on Hopkins  itself. An inevitable
    side  effect is  that Hopkins  tides are  complex and  severe, with the
    result  that most  habitation is  well  in  land and  high up,  and sea
    transport is minimal.

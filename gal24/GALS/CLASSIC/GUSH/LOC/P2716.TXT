    Subsector capital of Isi Ahto, Shakhamash ( also known as SHK ) lies on
    the boundary  of the Lancian Cultural  Region. The world itself  is not
    strongly  Lancian, and  has more   in common  with the  more industrial
    worlds  to rim.  A water  world, Shakhamash  has a  very strong  mining
    industry, particularly  radioactives and raw hydrocarbons,  and is well
    regarded for  its intrinsically safe and  harsh environment robots. The
    world has a  company style government, with each  district and function
    being run  as the subsidiary  of a world  "holding company". The  World
    Holding  Company CEO  is a   man known  simply as  Trintel. Pig-tailed,
    bearded,  smartly dressed  and never  without his  wry smile Trintel is
    known throughout  the sector as  a most ruthless  and scheming business
    man  who  never   shirks  from  ways  to  make   money.  Shakhamash  is
    orchestrated by  him into one  enormous industrial force,  with outside
    ownership  of  companies  being  tightly  regulated,  and  all internal
    business dealings of any sort having to be "signed-off" by a government
    representative.  One of  the few  examples of  Lancian influence is the
    fact that all Shakhamashi are effectively  employed by and payed by the
    state, not by the company they  work for. Shakhamash can be a nightmare
    for free-traders trying to sell or buy, and the services of a local and
    knowledgeable  agent  are  vital.  On  Shakhamash  the major government
    departments   are   production,   marketing,   information,  and  human
    resources. Need more be said?

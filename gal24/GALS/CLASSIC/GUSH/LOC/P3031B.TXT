
    El Tquii Nebula

    Between  grids 2932  and 2933  in  Lagan  Subsector lies  the El  Tquii
    nebula. This  gaseous nebula extends  for nearly one  and a half  light
    years and its  glorious colours dominate the skies  of Grebele, Teghde,
    and other nearby  worlds. Deep in the heart of  the nebula lie a couple
    of young suns, whose development is closely watched by the IISS base on
    Grebele. Periodic  survey expeditions are  made into the  centre of the
    nebula, and automated recording stations  are deployed in various parts
    of the nebula to keep a constant record of the stellar evolution.

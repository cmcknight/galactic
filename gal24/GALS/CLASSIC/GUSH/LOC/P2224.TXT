    The Vilani established the first  capital of Gushemege at Masa/Isi Ahto
    ( 2513 ) in -7892. During the Nth Interstellar War the Solomani blitzed
    Masa  and moved  the sector  capital to  Kamurinmur in  -2204, where it
    remained until the Long Night descended. After the Long Night the Third
    Imperium capital  of Gushemege was re-established  at Kamurinmur, which
    had  survived  the  darkness  in  reasonable  shape.  During  Civil War
    (604-629)  Gushemege,  and  Kamurinmur  in  particular,  sided  against
    Arbellatra. On  the conclusion of the  Civil War many of  the disgraced
    elements of the Navy found their way to Kamurinmur and conceived a long
    term  plan  to  overthrow  Arbellatra   and  her  line.  In  760  their
    descendents  launched  a  rebellion  which  was  meant  to spark off an
    Imperium  wide  over-throw  of  Paulo  1  and  the Alkhalikoi line. The
    rebellion  had the  active support   of many  Kamurinmur and  the tacit
    support of  the Sector Duke.  After much bloody  fighting the rebellion
    was crushed by  loyal IN and IISS CSB  forces.  In 761 Paulo I  decided
    that Kamurinmur  had forfeited its right  to be the Sector  Capital and
    moved the  Gushemege capital to  Usdiki/Rure ( 1015  ), and the  Sector
    Duchy was transferred to Duke Eneri  Miikadgaa, whose line rules to the
    present  day (  1116 ).  Subsequent investigations  into the Kamurinmur
    rebellion  linked  the  rebels  closely  with  the  Shakhamash Psionics
    Institue. This was one of the factors  which led to the turn of tide in
    public  opinion which  resulted in  the Psionic  Suppressions. Although
    Usdiki has been the sector capital  since 761 many Solomani still think
    of Kamurinmur as the Gushemege capital.  This may explain why some maps
    and data confuse the two locations and names.

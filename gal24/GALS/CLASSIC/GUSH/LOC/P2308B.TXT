    The Myem Gleece  is a huge omnivore that is  native to the desert world
    of  Choma. The  Myem Gleece   masses 1600kg  and resembles  the extinct
    terran  brontosaurus. The  Myem Gleece  has evolved  an original way of
    gathering  and carrying  water. It  is capable  of secreting  a conical
    membrane  in holes  in the  sand that  then collect  moisture. The Myem
    Gleece then harvests these and transfers  the water parcels to a "water
    stomach". As  a byproduct these "oasis",  which can be several  tens of
    meters across,  attract plant and animal  life as fast as  they attract
    water, providing complete nourishment  packages. They are known amongst
    Choma bedouin as "Gleeceburgers".

    Mzimbe has  been embroiled in  a civil war  since 1115 when  the tribal
    Laout rose up  against the Abact Corporation who  ran the world's Whega
    trade. The Whega are sheep  sized bulbous invertabrae that live beneath
    the desert's  surface and whose reproductive  glands secrete a chemical
    that is much prized by the Aslan as an aromatic oil.

    Chzaar is the  main S'mrii world in Gushemege.  The world was colonised
    around -10,000  by ram ship and  was the site of  first contact between
    the S'mrii  and the Kukhunen  ( who were  in the tow  of the Vilani  ).
    Today Chzaar is the headquarters  of the Lancian-S'mrii Institute and a
    major  centre  for  nanotech  and  neurotech  research.  The  Gushemege
    headquarters of the ZKK agency is also based here.

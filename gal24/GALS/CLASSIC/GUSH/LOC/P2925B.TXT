
    Way of Tuyll

    The Way of Tuyll is an important  religion to many in Shire. Having its
    origins on the Alsan world of Hkeakewoirea'  the Way of Tuyll is more a
    morale code  than a religion. The  Way was responsible for  holding the
    region together during the long night  as it stressed the importance of
    maintaining high ethical  and morale standards in times  of trouble for
    their  own rewards.  The Way  has some  800,000 sworn  members, but the
    number of followers is closer to 20 million.

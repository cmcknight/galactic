    Eralt  is an  undesireable world  having a  highly corrosive atmosphere
    with a dominance of  chloric/sulphuric acid vapour. Surface temperature
    ranges between  323 and 373K.  The relatively high  surface gravity and
    heavy molecular composition of the atmosphere combine to give the "air"
    an oily feel, and Eralt is known  by its few inhabitants as "old napalm
    world".  The  locals  are  the  remnants  of  a long abandoned Solomani
    geneered colonisation  effort. The Eralti  live in underground  caverns
    and the occasional  domed city. They have been geneered  to have a very
    thick,  almost   hide-like,  skin,  with  no   surface  hair.  A  thick
    translucent  membrane covers  their eyes  when in  the open,  and their
    respiratory  system has  been modified  to an  extent to  cope with the
    acidic atmosphere. Even with the modifications the Eralti can only stay
    outside for up to 6 hours  before suffering ill effects. The Eralti are
    a very uneasy people, who see little  hop for their future, and scratch
    out a very meager existence from  the geo-extraction  industry. A scout
    base has been established to provide  help and assistance to the rather
    wretched people who live on the planet.

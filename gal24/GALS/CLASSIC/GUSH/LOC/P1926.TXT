
    Howarth ( 1926 B2628CB-D )

    Howarth  is a  small world  with  a  relatively high  population (  700
    million )  and a good tech  level ( TL13 ).  The pressure of population
    and  the  continous  water  shortage  as  led  to  a clear governmental
    objective,  and a  significant  importance  being placed  on ordinances
    related to  movement, housing, and  water use. As  a result whilst  the
    government is entrusted to a competent President the real power lies in
    the Bects, or courts. These are  drawn from a judicial profession which
    Howarthi can elect to enter from  age 30, subject to passing a rigorous
    socio-ethical examination and legal  apprenticeship. The average age of
    Becten  is  45,  and  they  are  well  regarded  by the majority of the
    population, due to their near  ideal balance of experience, good sense,
    and  relative  youth.  It  is  this  trust  in  the Becten that enables
    Howarthi  to live  easily with   the prevalent  extreme law  level. The
    Howartian jungles are the original home of the Vesu gliders.

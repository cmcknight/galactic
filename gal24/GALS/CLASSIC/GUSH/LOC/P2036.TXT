    Gushirdiimi is a  heavily industrialised but water poor  world lying on
    the Susadimaa trade route. Gushirdiimi is the centre of a loose trading
    confederation of  states centred on the  Gushirdiimi and Rean clusters.
    The confederation  grew out of agricentric  trade, and also acted  as a
    buffer to  the Ilelish revolt  of the 400s.  Gushiridiimi is run  by an
    extreme  socialist democracy,  and high  taxes reminiscent  of those in
    some  Lancian worlds  are the  order of  the day.  Gushirdiimi suffered
    badly  in  the  past  from  exhaust  pollution  of  its  precious water
    supplies. This has led the government to ban private transport. Instead
    the  planet is  equipped with  a superb  public transportation  system,
    based  on  enclosed  monorails  and  surface  trams.  Stations and town
    centres  has  electro-bikes  available  on  a  "pick'n'dump" basis. The
    security forces are the only  people allowed grav craft and travellers'
    craft are not allowed beyond Lyon Highport.

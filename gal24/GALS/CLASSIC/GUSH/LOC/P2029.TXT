
    Trill ( 2029 A784977-F N Hi )                                circa 1116

    Trill is  a balkanised industrial  world with a  high population and  a
    near  terran  prime  biosphere.   Trill's  many  distinct  nations  all
    jealously  guard their  own independence;  there are  15 major nations,
    each  with  a  population  of  about  100  million. Trill's nations are
    particularly  sensitive  about  border  incursions,  and  even  pitched
    battles  and military  campaigns on   Trill are  forced to  observe and
    respect national  borders or risk  retaliation by the  offended country
    and  alienation from  other nations.  There are  two orbital starports,
    each run  by a different  grouping of nations,  and three nations  have
    Class A dirtside facilities, most others having B or C class starports.
    Travellers will find it a long and frustrating process to cross borders
    on Trill,  and often a  visit to  one  nation will preclude  a visit to
    certain others.

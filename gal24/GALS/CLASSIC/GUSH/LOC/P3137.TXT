    As  On As  is owned  by Ewne  LIC, a  subsector-wide agrobusiness.  The
    planet  produces a  wide variety  of vegetable  and fungal produce. The
    planet  has   no  animal  life,  and   as  a  result  the   plants  are
    tuber-producing rather than fruit bearing. Some  find As On As a rather
    bleak world but  it is highly profitable for  Ewne. The corporation and
    planetary government  works by co-opting  the top perfomers  in various
    grades to the executive board for two-year terms.


    Lancian Cultural Region

    Tansa subsector lies at the centre  of the Lancian Cultural Region, and
    contains the Lancian home, Kukhun. The Lancian culture developed during
    the  Long  Knight  and  stresses   the  importance  of  creativity  and
    contribution.  Creativity   is  evident  in   the  art,  pacifism   and
    originality  of  Lancian  culture.  Lancian  artistry  and  originality
    accounts for Lancia's dominant  position within Imperial entertainment,
    and  its strong  bonds with  Makhidkarun and  the S'mrii.  The ethic of
    contribution  is  reflected  in  peripheral  fields  like  the  endemic
    medianet and the high degree  of participation in Lancian society. Most
    importantly it underpins the whole  of Lancian economics, and the trust
    on  which the  extreme socialist  syustem is  based. Travellers  to the
    region would  be well advised  to read up  on Lancian economics  before
    venturing  into  the  area.  For  the  historically minded the Cultural
    Region was formally established in 639 by Empress Arbellatra, partly as
    a thank-you for the regions support to  her during the Civil War. Other
    major centres of Lancian culture in Tansa are Raoh and Shiramuunir.

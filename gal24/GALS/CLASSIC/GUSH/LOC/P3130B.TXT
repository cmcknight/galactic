    Wastex Stellar is a permanent exhibition and conference for the stellar
    waste  disposal  industry.  Sited  at  Soave,  the  only  settlement on
    Akhudgir( 3130,  q.v. ) Wastex  Stellar specialises in  the disposal of
    highly  dangerous waste,  usually by  either stellar  burial, graveyard
    orbits or deep space burial. Wastex is the centre of frequent campaigns
    and  probes as  many, including  the Greunemir  ( q.v.  ) environmental
    organisation, find  the simplistic methods of  Wastex Stellar's members
    to be highly quetionable.

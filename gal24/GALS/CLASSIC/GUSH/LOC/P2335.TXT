    Chipoka is  home to the  Ceblel Psionic Institute.  The Ceblel Institue
    was secretly founded in 800 after the Psionic Suppression had subsided.
    The Institue specialises in  research into telemobility. The institutes
    cover is drug research, drawing on the richness of Chipoka's agriflora.
    As  well as  medicinal and   recreational drugs  the Ceblel  also makes
    PsiDrugs which  are distributed to other  institutes engaged on Psionic
    and Neurotek research. One of the  most popular drugs is Gamlestaden, a
    cyber-rejection inhibitor. "Gam"  has a street value of  2KCr per shot.
    Referee: Rumours persist that  Ceblel is spearheading Imperial research
    into Jump  Commandoes for service  against the Zhodani  in the Spinward
    Marches. The rumour  is true, but is more of  a private venture than an
    Imperial funded activity.

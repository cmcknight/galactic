
    Plutand Economic Union ( -1309 to c.-540 )

    As Gushemege sunk  into the Long Night the  desert world of Unlardigard
    found  itself in  dire straits,  since the  minimal native life offered
    little  sustenance and  the hydroponic  gardens were  prone to failure.
    Trill, as  a better endowed  near terran-prime world,  extracted a high
    price for its agricultural trade, and assumed the position of overlord.
    As the Night  deepened Trill's higher technology began  failing, and it
    became   dependent   on   the   resourcefulness   of   the  Unlardigard
    technologists. In  -1309 the two  worlds signed the  Treaty of Plutand,
    pledging  mutual   aid  and  support.   Using  Trillian  hardware   and
    Unlardigard know-how the  Plutand Economic Union was able  to reach out
    to Xanten, Glipli, and even occasionally  to Zanish. The Union was able
    to sustain TL10 for most of the Long Night.

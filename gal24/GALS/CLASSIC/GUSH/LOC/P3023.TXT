    The Suysu system is a not a place to be visited lightly. Its Amber zone
    posting is due  to the rough hued denizens who  dwell there. The Susysu
    system was the scene of a crystals  rush in 733 and although the zuchai
    crystals were soon spent the Suysu belt was found to be rich in mineral
    bearing Nickel-Iron asteroids. The miners and prospectors came to stay,
    along  with  a  following  of  spaceship  repair, banking, and security
    firms. Nearly four hundred years later they are still there. Suysu Belt
    is governed by a council of  directors of the leading businesses. Suysu
    itself is the corporate and governmental  centre, with a high law level
    enforced by  Datuum Security, a private  security firm. Frequent pirate
    raids  along the  Oulpath and   nearby XBoat  routes and  mineral raids
    against Oieakh  ( 2924 ) have  been attributed to Suysu.  The situation
    has however brought Suysu close to  war with the Aslan worlds of Oieakh
    and Hkeakewoirea'.  The scout bases at  Goye and Suysu have  stepped up
    policing of the  area and IN squadrons at Vohitsara  have carried out a
    number of cutlass rattling exercises in the area.

    Referee: Suysu  is also the  home of Brisse's  Brigands, a pirate  band
    acting with  Suysu government sanction. Brisse's  Brigands have 5 armed
    merchants,  2 corsairs,  a scout  and a  Broadsword class  cruiser. The
    ships  average TL11.  There are  close links  between Brisse and Datuum
    Security.

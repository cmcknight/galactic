    Fligh (pronounced  flee-gh) Transportation is  a frieght and  passenger
    feeder line operating out of Edat. FLT operates along the length of the
    Oulpath between  Shakhamash and Phaln.  Edat proves to  be a good  base
    since its 0 law level makes all sorts of creative dealing possible. FLT
    operates a  fleet of some 50  ships, with a further  50 operating under
    licence.

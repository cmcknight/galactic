
    Battle of Oneria, -2221

    The  Battle  of  Oneria  was  one  of  the  major  battles  of  the Nth
    Interstellar  War.  Early  in  -2221  the  Solomani  fleet  was pushing
    coreward when it came across the  minor rift that runs just coreward of
    Oneria. Whilst  they prepared a  bridgehead for the  J-1 logistic craft
    the Vilani  took their chance and  pounced from Koustorm. Unfortunately
    the  situation was  a Solomani  trap and  the Solomani  were ready  and
    defeated the  Vilani. The remnants  of the Vilani  fleet fled to  their
    base  at  Shakhamash  to  defend  Masa  and  prepare  for  the Solomani
    onslaught.

From:  Gushemege Sector Admiral Sir Khesa Lusur
To:  Duke Kirshaam Miikudgaa
Date: 250-1116
Sir. As requested here are the latest fleet dispositions and assessments of you
r loyal  fleet.  As you can see we are generally in good health although the la
ck of any significant recent action makes the fleets true worth  an unknown var
iable. Whilst
we have some excellent Admirals I  am concerned about a few and have instructed
  Admiral Rackham, to personally keep an eye on them. The fleet awaits to do yo
ur bidding.
I am, Sir, your most obedient servant, Lusur
##### Message Ends #####


Gushemege Fleet         Usdiki/Dashinshaii
Sector Admiral Kasar Lusur (m)  PF2 TF1

The Grand Admiral is a fearless leader who gained first hand combat experience
against the Vargr. He was appointed Grand Admiral in 1109. With his fleet exper
ience far outwaying his staff tours he lacks the diplomatic niceties, and is no
t use to comp
omise. He was a good friend of Duke Sirgi and is loyal to the Imperium.

Admiral (Operations) Stella Rackham (f) PF1 TF0

Admiral Rackham does not share Lusur's combat experience. The best she managed
was police and ant-pirate actions. She is however an excellent leader, ably mot
ivating her crews, for whom she cares deeply. She has a superb grasp of logisti
cs. She follo
ed Strephon loyally but has a strong desire to see combat.  ##### Based on repo

272nd Aggressor Fleet                    Puumariash/Khiira ( Subsector B )

Admiral Rukka Gaanriigashi (f)          PF3 TF0

3209 CruRon     TL13    C4SL    Puumariash  ( 1507 )

The 272nd Fleets primary mission is to act as an aggressor unit for fleet train
ing. It plays host to Squadrons from elsewhere in the Sector for training and R
ift experience. Admiral Gaanriigashi is a Vilani but her loyalty rests first wi
th her men. W
ilst not loyal to Vland she is not especially loyal to the Imperium either. If
put in a corner she would probably seek the most sensible result for her and he
r fleet.

211th Penetration Fleet            Brice/Taapvaia ( Subsector C )
Admiral Dwil Van Sant (m)               PF3 TF2

2838 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    Brice ( 2110 )
4565 AssltRon(Inv)      TL14    A3SL    Ivto ( 2106 )
9728 TankRon          TL13      T3SL    Roy ( 1801 )

Admiral Van Sant is very ambitious. In command he is hard to hold back, and lik
es to go for the juggular. Luckily he is an excellent tactician otherwise he wo
uld be liable to end up in trouble. He is loyal to his men, and to the "Imperiu
m".


1241st Reserve Fleet
Admiral Gamaagin Limmishga (f)          PF2 TF0

6248 CruRonCol     TL13 C4SL    Sharenga ( 2305 )
4613 TankRonCol TL13    T3SL    Irkhi ( 2207 )

Admiral Limmishga is of Vilani descent but fiercely loyal to the Imperium and S
trephon. She is brave and a good leader. She has her eye on the command of a re
gular fleet.

142nd Strike Fleet                 2910/Tansa ( Subsector D )
Admiral Maru Brisse (m)         PF2 TF-1

167  BatRon              TL14   B4SL    2910
2260 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    2704
1364 CruRon              TL13   C4SL    2509
6303 CruRon(Carrier)    TL14    C4SL    2701
4481 AssltRon(Inv)      TL14    A3SL    3004
6641 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    Kukhun ( 3105 )
4069 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    2809
3203 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    3203

A well equipped fleet the 142nd has recently seen duty on the Vargr border as p
art of a relief tour for the Vland Fleet. Admiral Brisse was a fierce supporter
 of Strephon and will be heavily effected by his death. He is a fair and though
tful leader,
nd integrates well with his Squadron leaders. He is not brilliant as a tacticia
n, but avoided making any serious blunders during the Vland tour.

1004th Reserve Fleet
Admiral Munush Irliaarka (f)            PF2 TF0

3287 CruRonCol           TL12   C3SL    2507
3655 AssltRonCol(Tpt)   TL12    A2SL    2907
8284 TankRonCol       TL11      T2SL    3105

Admiral Irliaarka is of Vilani descent but loyal to the "greater" Imperium. She
 is distant and reserved and has little concern for her crews. She is a good ad
minstrator and made command on her showing as a staff officer at the Admiralty.


231st Penetration Fleet               1616/Rure ( Subsector F )
Admiral Wessen Sayourth (m)             PF1 TF-1

912   Batron          TL14      B4SL    1616
2785 CruRon(Carrier)    TL14    C4SL    0718 ( Gandonen Subsector )
8134 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    Munnarn ( 1013 )
935  CruRon             TL14    C4SL    1414
6562 AssltRon(Inv)      TL14    A3SL    1213
2585 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    1019
4321 TankRon          TL13      T3SL    1319

The 231st Fleet's mission is to patrol the Archipelago and to be prepared for R
ift operations. Admiral Sayourth is highly loyal to the ideals of the Third Imp
erium. He is a good stategician, but has a false assessment of his tactical ski
lls. Sayourth
has revelled in the prestige that the 231st's role in the Archipelago has given
 him, and is dismissive of the "interior" fleets.

1148th Reserve Fleet
Admiral Rece Dunnass (m)                PF3 TF0

6709  AssltRonCol(Inv)  TL11    A2SL    2313 ( from Ankhsusgar )
12146 AssltRonCol(Tpt)  TL13    A3SL    1616
8270  TankRonCol              TL13      T3SL    1015

Admiral Dunnass was a keen supporter of Strephon. He is aggressive in battle, a
nd only slighly less so in the wardroom.


271st Interdiction Fleet                Lumuiimshi/Ankhsusgar ( Subsector G )
Admiral Mazun Shemakirga (m)            PF2 TF1

138  CruRon              TL14   C4SL    2217
2281 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    Lumuiimshi ( 1816 )
2460 AssltRon(Inv)      TL14    A3SL    2018
8844 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    2415

Admiral Shemakirga is from a Vilani family that has always been resentful of th
e Miikadgaa families hold on Gushemege.  He has already signalled the Admiralty
 pledging his loyalty to Lucan. None of this though belies the fact that he is
a fair and br
ve commander who has done a good job of commanding what is often seen as a poor
 Fleet. The 6709 Colonial Squadron from the subsector is assigned to the 1148th
 Reserve Fleet. It should be noted that the Admiralty Alternate Headquarters is
 at Lumuiimsh
.

126th Battle Fleet                 Shakhamash/Isi Ahto ( Subsector H )
Admiral Nena Elhian (f)         PF2 TF1

713  BatRon(Battlerider)        TL14    B5SL    2914
916  BatRon(Battlerider)        TL14    B5SL    Shakhamash ( 2716 )
6134 CruRon(Carrier)          TL14      C4SL    2815
2837 TankRon                TL14        T3SL    2814

The 126th Battle Fleet is the premier fleet of Gushemege. Its Squadrons are rou
tinely sent to Vland and Corridor for combat experience. Admiral Elhian is uniq
uely a Lancian. Like most Lancians who make it into the military she is aggress
ive and loves
a good fight, seeing it almost as an art form, and giving it her all. She is a
cousin of the subsector Duchess, but unlike her namesake her loyalty is more to
 the Imperium as a whole than to Lancia specifically.

1079th Depot Fleet                       Depot/Isi Ahto
1158th Security Fleet                 Depot/Isi Ahto
1065th Training Fleet                 Depot/Isi Ahto
Admiral Guniid Gramercy (m)             PF0 TF0

Admiral Gramercy commands all of the Depot based fleets.  The "fleet" title are
 something of a misnomer, the fleets being more of Squadron size, although larg
e numbers of ships are kept mothballed. All the active ships of the  fleets are
 equipped to
L14 standards, with mothballed ships stretching back to TL11. Admiral Gramercy
is the senior Admiral and previously commanded 142nd Strike Fleet. Gramercy has
 a tendency to live in the past and paints a somewhat glorified picture of his
own experienc
s.

1094th Reserve Fleet
Admiral Daniel Thulin (m)               PF3 TF1

149  BatRonCol           TL12   B3SL    Shakhamash
3251 CruRonCol(Carrier) TL12    C2USL   3218
6145 CruRonCol           TL13   C4SL    2513
7443 TankRonCol       TL13      T3SL    2920
11416 TankRonCol              TL13      T3SL    2620

Admiral Thulin is a good commander who likes to lead by example. He has the ful
l confidence of his crews, and was a firm supporter of the late Strephon and th
e Third Imperium.


232nd Strike Fleet                    0729/Balech ( Subsector I )
Admiral Sabe Mezregh (f)                PF2 TF0

476  BatRon              TL14   B4SL    0729
1617 CruRon(Carrier)    TL13    C4SL    0428
7287 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    0722
11470 CruRon          TL13      C4SL    0327
3366 TankRon          TL13      T3SL    0223

Admiral Mezregh is a risk taker whose normally placid demeanour changes the min
ute she takes the helm. Her last psychscan showed her to be becoming increasing
ly unbalanced. The death of Strephon has reportedly effected her very badly. Ad
miral Rackham
has been briefed to keep her under review. She is a good strategician and it wo
uld be a pity to lose her.

1109th Reserve Fleet
Admiral Sir Enli Kulesh (m)             PF3 TF0

481   CruRonCol TL13    C4SL    0923 ( from Sallounn )
2624 TankRonCol TL12    T2SL    0727

481 CruRonCol is assigned from Sallounn Subsector. The Vilani Admiral Sir Enli
Kulesh has kept close to his Vilani roots, and often wears Vilani noble dress.
His family is prominent in Gushemege Vilani society.  He does however relish hi
s command on
he edge of the Rift and is a fair, if ruthless, leader.

38th Strike Fleet                           Vesuata/Sallounn ( Subsector J )
Admiral Lian Kaagaarkha (m)             PF1 TF-1

773  BatRon              TL13   B4SL    1430
4336 CruRon(Carrier)    TL14    C4SL    0921
8538 CruRon(Carrier)    TL14    C4SL    1522
4226 CruRon              TL13   C4SL    Vesuata ( 1328 )
932  CruRon             TL14    C4SL    1528
836  AssltRon(Inv)      TL14    A3SL    1426
1178 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    1530
9576 TankRon          TL13      T3SL    1423

Admiral Kaagaarkha is another that I am having Rackham watch. He is an excellen
t battlefleet commander, if a little foolhardy in the heat of battle, but as a
person he has a reputation for sadistic leadership. He reportedly had a ship's
captain shot
or poor performance, and commonly uses his sabre for disciplining his subordina
tes. In spite of this he has built a loyal following, and his crews know that A
dmiral Kaagaarkha would lead the way with bravery in battle. He has already ple
dged his supp
rt to Lucan as Emporer.


89th Strike Fleet                        Usdiki/Dashinshaii ( Subsector K )
Admiral Sala Naanuurmu (f)              PF1 TF1

81   BatRon              TL14   B4SL    Usdiki ( 2224 )
1894 CruRon(Carrier)    TL13    C4SL    2029
5973 CruRon(Carrier)    TL14    C4SL    1724
1235 CruRon              TL13   C4SL    2130
3780 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    1823
6872 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    2022
7619 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    1722
11570 TankRon         TL14      T3SL    2122

89th Strike Fleets mission is the defense of the Sector capital, a mission whic
h it never felt that it would have to fulfil. Now who can say. The Fleet has ra
pidly lost its ceremonial trappings and Admiral Naanuurmu is doing an excellent
 job in bring
ng the fleet to a fully operational footing. She is one of the best Admirals we
 have, and along with Admiral Rackham is in the running to command the Gushemeg
e Fleet.

1102nd Reserve Fleet
Admiral Robar Serreau (m)               PF1 TF-1

717  BatRonCol           TL13   B4SL    2029
9897 CruRonCol(Carrier) TL11    C2USL   2325
7674 CruRonCol           TL13   C4SL    1930
7745 TankRonCol       TL13      T3SL    Usdiki
9848 TankRonCol       TL12      T2SL    2127

Admiral Serreau is the youngest of the Admirals. He is relatively inexperienced
 but has performed excellently on fleet manoeuvres. He is keen to see battle in
 any form. He idolised Strephon and has been quite shaken by his assasination.
Being based h
re at Usdiki we have been able to keep an eye on him and I am sure that he will
 soon regain his composure.

127th Assault Fleet                   2526/Shire ( Subsector L )
Admiral Kello Dartus (f)                PF2 TF0

4345 CruRon              TL14  C4SL     3223
5240 CruRon              TL13   C4SL    3029
4756 AssltRon(Inv)      TL14    A3SL    2526
2693 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    2829
4811 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL13    A3SL    2525
6937 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    2921
470  TankRon          TL14      T3SL    3027
1332 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    3230

Darhus was devoted to Strephon, and like Admiral Serreau she shows all the sign
s of wanting to persue a personal vengence crusade. Admiral Darhus is a virtuou
s leader with a strong sense of justice, which no doubt accounts for her horror
 at the assas
nation of Strephon, and at Lucan's succession.

1232nd Reserve Fleet
Admiral  Jael Meing (m)         PF1 TF0

3203 CruRonCol        TL12      C3SL    Kadar ( 2839/Truax )
9426 CruRonCol        TL12      C3SL    2925
3726 AssltRonCol(Tpt)TL12       A2SL    2627
4399 AssltRonCol(Tpt)TL12       A2SL    2828

Admiral Meing is well liked by his crews. Although intimidating and aggressive
when first met Meing reveals a more cautious and open character when challenged
.

37th Interdiction Fleet            0733/Vipach ( Subsector M )
Admiral Jihom Uwnelm (m)                PF3 TF-1

248  CruRon              TL14   C4SL    0140
9446 AssltRon(Inv)      TL13    A3SL    0733
1362 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    0536
2897 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    Dikaash ( 0738 )
6684 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    0631

Admiral Uwnelm is a source of great concern. He is exceedingly ambitious and ha
s been ruthless in his rise to the rank of Admiral. IThere is no doubt that he
seeks the Grand Admiralty, and if rumour is to be beleived he has his sights se
t even higher
than that. He has not yet come out in support of Lucan, which would have been e
xpected. He may well be biding his time, as his proximity to Ilelish would put
him close to the front should war break out. The Security Division of INI have
been alerted
o our doubts about Admiral Uwnelm, but he is yet to do anything that could just
ify his removal.

        Naval Bases in Gushemege - 1116


1246th Reserve Fleet
Admiral Khugi Upigiia (m)               PF2 TF0

6720 CruRonCol           TL13   C4SL    0137
12109 AssltRonCol(Tpt)  TL12    A2SL    Dikaash
4932 TankRonCol       TL13      T3SL    0839

Upigiia is a good Vilani Admiral, although he does have a tendency to attempt t
o cover up his mistakes. This is more a result of his not wanting to lose the c
hance to be in the thick of it than out of any self-doubt. Should Uwnelm prove
unreliable I
m sure that Upigiia would make a satisfactory replacement.




39th Assault Fleet                    Sidur Ishki/Laeth ( Subsector N )
Admiral Mazun Argukar (m)               PF2 TF0

798  CruRon              TL14   C4SL    1534
5465 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    1440
7659 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    0937
3821 AssltRon(Inv)      TL14    A3SL    1137
6366 AssltRon(Inv)      TL14    A3SL    1532
2135 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    1038
3614 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL13    A3SL    1036
5476 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    Sidur Ishki ( 1234 )
8647 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    1432
8875 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    1136
9678 TankRon          TL13      T3SL    1033
        
Admiral Argukar is an aggressive and impulsive leader, with a tendency to impet
uousness.He was however a loyal supporter of Strephon, and has ordered his flee
t into 100 days mouning. The 39th is the largest fleet in the Sector and is wel
l trained and
well equipped for planetary assault.

1176th Reserve Fleet
Admiral Olke Nuserm (m)         PF3 TF1

7536 CruRonCol           TL12   C3SL    1236
4686 AssltRonCol(Inv)   TL11    A2SL    Sidur Ishki
6079 AssltRonCol(Tpt)   TL12    A2SL    1038

Admiral Nuserm is loyal to his crews but very ambitious. He has niether the int
elligence or delusions of Uwnelm, but this does not mean that if given the chan
ce to further his standing he would not size the opportunity. The ambition has
always been p
esent to a degree, but he felt slighted at being given only a reserve fleet com
mand and this has given his ambition a keener, more desparate, edge. It should
also be noted that Nusrem comes from a Rim family and this could bring his loya
lties into qu
stion.

90th Assault Fleet                    2333/Truax ( Subsector O )
Admiral Sharik Batuum (f)               PF4 TF2

4204 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    2333
8801 CruRon              TL14   C4SL    2438
6709 AssltRon(Inv)      TL13    A3SL    1734
9968 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    2036
9987 AssltRon(Tpt)      TL14    A3SL    2237
6193 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    2134
9676 TankRon          TL14      T3SL    2031

Admiral Batuum is a good tactician but moody, boastful and uncaring. She is unl
iked by her fleet, who find her difficult to please when in port. As far as the
 Admiralty is concerned she does a good job, and has successfully provided supp
ort and advic
 to planets facing separatist problems within the Rim.

1266th Reserve Fleet
Admiral Thomas Oormor (m)               PF3 TF3

6066 CruRonCol           TL11   C2SL    2037
8418 AssltRonCol(Inv)   TL12    A2SL    2036
9032 AssltRonCol(Tpt)   TL13    A3SL    2439
6338 TankRonCol       TL13      T3SL    1733

Admiral Oormor is a rising star. He is young, resposnsible, and amiable. He is
a peaceful man in private but an excellent tactician when at the helm. His tenu
re at the 1266th is likely to last only until a suitable fleet of the line comm
and becomes v
cant.

The 101st's mission is to provide training support for the Assault Fleets and f
or the IISS training facilities in the Subsector. Admiral Thec is a sober but a
miable person who tends to caution in battle. He does however have a fine grasp
 of stategy,
ven if it is more academic than practical. The 3203rd Colonial Squadron is deta
ched to 1232nd Reserve Fleet.

Massilia Sector - Credits
-------------------------

The Massilia Sector data was ftped from Sunbane.

This sector was also covered to some extent in issue 11 of
The Travellers' Digest put out by Digest Group Publications
in 1988. The people involved in the Massilia write-up from
that issue were Nancy Parker and Robert Parker.

One interesting tidbit about this sector is that while
DGP spells it "Massilia", GDW seems to prefer the spelling
"Massila". I wrote the TML asking for an explanation, and
Mark Seemann (mark@dk-online.dk) wrote me back with the
following:

     Massilia is the Latin word for the French city of
     Marseilles. It makes good sense that Solomani
     conquerers would name a sector after a Terran city,
     and the name would then have stuck. I don't think
     Massila means anything, and having heard about DGP's
     Gary Thomas' fondness for ancient Terran languages,
     this explanation makes the most sense to me.

For this reason, and for the reason that DGP (not GDW) did the
development of this sector, I decided to go with their version
of the name.

   SYZYGY SUBSECTOR (ca. 1117)
 
         This subsector will always be remembered in history for containing
    the world which became the first meeting place between a Human from
    Terra/Sol and a Hiver from Guaran/Hive. That world is Momentory (2632).
    It is where a long-range exploration vessel from Guaran had to land to
    make emergency repairs. A mute Terran scout, Franklin Cheevers, was
    able to assist the Hiver/Gurvin team with their jump drive. Relations
    have been cordial ever since, with the recent Solomani tensions a
    low-point in that nearly 3,000 year history.
         The Dolphins at Hrilll (2834) were there before the Hivers came
    to Spica sector. They chose not to join the Federation and willingly
    accepted the Hiver Interdiction. This colony is twice removed from
    Terra, having been an off-shoot of Delphin Colon(y) (2916 Aldebaran).
    For whatever reason, Dolphins don't pronounce the 'y'.
         Yard Explorer (2938) is the regional starship yard that Star
    Patterns Trading Company uses to produce its successful version of
    the 200 ton type-HX Hiver Explorer.

      This system have probably gone through more hardship than most
      other systems in Gvurrdon. The population lives under ground in
      tunnels. When the system was first settled for 800 years ago it
      boasted with an advanced TL 11 technology. Then the disaster
      struck. The small government did not succeed in controlling the
      masses and civil war broke out. Following this war the world
      got splintered between several powerblocks. With more than 600
      years of war and other minor conflicts the TL started to
      decline when the harsh environment took its toll on the
      equipment. The fact is that the surface temperature of this
      planet can sink down to -237C. The following wars was then the
      matter of survival for the powerblocks. About 50 years ago this
      system did get help from outside by request from some minor
      factions. Firstly the helpers was met with resistance, but
      later when the other factions had expended their stock of
      fighting materiel they had to succumb for outside pressure.
      From this point the planet got united under one central
      government. This planets largest export articles are a strange
      sort of algae that lives in the oceans of this planet. Orrkong,
      a shrimp like creature is also an export article.

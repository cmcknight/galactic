      trading center for the sector, but when the Kedzudh invaded
      the world in late 1118, Oberlindes had to close down the center
      and move it somewhere else. Oberlindes has made it clear that
      they are looking into reopening their old base here. Local
      investors are apparently doing their part to ensure that
      Oberlindes comes back.

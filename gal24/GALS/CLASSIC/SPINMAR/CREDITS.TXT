Spinward Marches - Credits
--------------------------

The Spinward Marches data was ftped from Sunbane.

Similar data seems to have been published in Supplement 3,
The Spinward Marches, put out by Game Designers' Workshop
in 1979. The Spinward Marches gives no credits, so it's
difficult to say who precisely was involved in its creation.

     Population about 72,000.  Colonized following the Third  Frontier 
War  in  990 by a group of Sword Worlds dissidents.   Recent  problems 
have stemmed from the fact that the inhabitants have more sympathy for 
the Sword Worlds their ancestors left than for the Imperium.   Glisten 
pre-emptively  assumed control of the planet in 1104, and tension  has 
remained high since.  The local language is a form of Germanic  rather 
than Anglic, and persons addressing the inhabitants in Anglic  outside 
the  controlled  spaceport district are likely to find  trouble.   The 
planet  itself  is fairly unpleasant, with most  of  the  hydrographic 
percentage  tied up in the two large icecaps.  Individual  settlements 
outside the spaceport tend to cluster around a pressurized greenhouse.  
Most surface travel is by tracked vehicle.

     TL6  is  barely sufficient to maintain the colony  domes  in  the 
trace atmosphere.  Formerly a mining colony founded to exploit massive 
quantities of silver, it has been on the decline since the silver gave 
out around 1020.  ConTech closed the starport in 1035, and most of the 
population  emigrated.   The remainder are expert  garbage  pickers--a 
fair  amount of useful salvage at TL12 remains from the mining  opera-
tion, enough that free traders occasionally call to pick up the junk.

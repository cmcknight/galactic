Overnale / Miscellaneous Notes

Kwikbite  is  a  Parlek fast food subsidiary  specializing  in  rabbit 
products and flavored fried rice cakes. A Kwikbite can be found in any 
town  of 5000 or more inhabitants in Parlek, and in any town of  10000 
or more in other countries.

Parlek is notorious as a laissez faire haven, and their data net  will 
provide any information at a price.

TL10 import goods from Horosho are generally available at 2x the usual 
prices.   TL11  goods  from New Rome are available  at  3x  the  usual 
prices,  and TL15 goods from Glisten are not generally available,  and 
cost  6x the usual prices and up when they can be found.  (This  would 
include any equipment from the lists rated at TL12-14.)

Dress: Inhabitants of Parlek dress any way they please, with an effect 
resembling  a  continuous  free form  costume  party  socially.   Work 
clothes  are the appropriate coveralls etc.  Norlanders wear a lot  of 
fur  and leather, weather permitting, often highly decorated.   Seamen 
and aviators favor jumpsuits in all countries.  Formal wear in Melorn, 
Griffin  Island and the Sea League runs to capes and flowing robes  in 
solids  and  stripes.   Daily wear tends  toward  loose  trousers  and 
blouses  with  decoration at the wrists, neck, and blouse  hem.   Cold 
weather  gear tends toward quilted jackets with attached hoods.   Sur-
plus  combat environment suits from New Rome were a big hit  when  im-
ported a few years ago, and can be often be seen in the Sea League  in 
cold weather.

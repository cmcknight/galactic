     Inchin  is occupied by a small group of military  personnel  from 
Avastan.  8000 people inhabit the one underground complex, and operate 
mining  and pharmaceutical production facilities.  All mine output  is 
reserved  for use by the Avastan government, but there is some  export 
of pharmaceuticals.  Almost all equipment is imported.

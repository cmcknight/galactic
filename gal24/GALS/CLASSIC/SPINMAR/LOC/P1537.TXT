Mertactor  is a low gravity planet with a dense atmosphere, and  as  a 
result much of the animal life has evolved into flyers of one sort  or 
another.  Human powered flight is a popular leisure activity.  Most of 
the  planet's water is scattered in small seas and large lakes  rather 
than  being concentrated in larger oceans.  The human  population  has 
adapted  to this by colonizing in small towns around the  shores,  and 
this has led to a tendency for the culture of the planet to be consid-
ered  rather boring by its neighbors.  About 10% of the population  is 
Aslan, descended from a group of mercenaries employed by the  Imperium 
around  950.  They are pretty thoroughly assimilated,  although  their 
presence does attract attention from Aslan long range traders.

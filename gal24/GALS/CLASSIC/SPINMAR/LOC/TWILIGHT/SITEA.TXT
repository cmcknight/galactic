    ------
    
   There is a small, partially shadowed, exposed area which appears to be
   part of some kind of larger crystalline structure embedded about half
   way up the cliff that is the north western face of the small volcanic
   peak here. There is a lava pool atop the small plateau which flows
   down the eastern side. This pool will make climbing down from the top
   somewhat difficult.
   
   Casual investigation from a distance will give the impression that the
   formation is artificial in nature. Close examination of the crystals
   will refute this, clearly indicating that the crystals are a naturally
   occurring phenomenon. Careful investigation by somebody with geology
   skill, reveals that the structure is composed of zuchai crystals, a
   vital component in jump drives, known for their almost perfect energy
   absorption and release. This dirt ball isn't valueless after all: this
   find alone is worth a major fortune to just about any mining company.

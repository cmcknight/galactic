      ------
   
   This is the complex's large communal recreation room. This room is
   pretty much a large open empty space. There are several desks just
   like the ones in the cells. There are also several seats or benches
   around that all have funny indentations for tails and and are without
   back supports. The ceiling displays a massive holograph of a reddish
   sky complete with moving cloud formations. If sufficient time is spent
   watching the sky, it will be noted that the cloud formations do not
   appear to repeat themselves and the level of illumination does not
   vary over time. That is, there is no separate day or night here.

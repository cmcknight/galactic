      ------
   
   This is the storeroom. Shelves are located along both long walls.
   These shelves hold many packing boxes (made of some unknown metal, if
   anybody asks). The boxes can easily be opened and most of them are
   empty (after all, the base has been here a long time). The boxes can
   contain whatever ultra high tech items the GM wishes to include.
   
   Some suggestions are:
     * Three large black bricks each with two flush metal discs on top.
       These are anti-matter batteries capable of all manner of wonderous
       power supply feats. They'll need an engineer to wire these up
       properly.
     * One pointy stick, just like the weapon on a deathbot. These cannot
       be powered up during the adventure, but they can be afterwards.
     * Very complex collection of circuits haphazardly connected together
       inside a six inch cube. This is a TL23 intelligent robotic brain.
       Given some study and a power supply, it will function perfectly.
       This one is immune to the child like attacks of the so called
       virus.
     * Black vial containing jet black stuff (maybe the vial isn't really
       black after all). The vial is a form of black globe and it
       contains a quantity of anti-matter. This could make an interesting
       weapon except that it will always undergo a controlled meltdown
       causing 1D of thermal damage per round to everything withing 30m
       for a rather extended period of time.
     * One box of forty TL22 self screwing nuts and bolts. Push the nut
       on gently and it screws itself tight and a very gentle pull
       removes it automatically. No more tiredness from using your
       spanners. No power source for this miracle is evident.

   Aryven has a very happy go lucky and personable attitude. You do jobs
   when you have to, but you only do the minimum necessary to finish the
   task. It isn't that you are lazy, you just don't want to waste time
   doing a full and proper job. You also don't react to orders in the
   best way. You resent authority and tend towards the undisciplined. You
   are also well known for the excessive quantities of small talk you
   produce seeming without end.
   
   Travil is an old stick in the mud. He gives orders far too much but at
   least he does seem to care about his team.
   
   Sherina is a lot of fun. She likes gossiping almost as much as you do
   and you frequently chatter away for hours. You often bait her on a
   little, but she has been know to get a little violent and bash you
   around too hard.
   
   Bruce is weird. He talks to you, but he doesn't really say anything.
   It is as if he doesn't have a history or a future, only a now. Still,
   he is better than some.
   
   Grindle and Bob keep very much to themselves. They avoid chattering to
   you. Not that this stops you chattering to them, it just makes things
   a little one sided.
   
   Grog also provides one sided conversations, but for a different
   reason: eloquent speech seems beyond his mental capabilities. He is a
   very bad cook, but you don't hurt his feelings by complaining.
   
   That leaves Hanit the egotistical Solomani supremist. The only
   conversation he spouts is canned political drivel from the crack pots
   on Terra. Dull dull dull.

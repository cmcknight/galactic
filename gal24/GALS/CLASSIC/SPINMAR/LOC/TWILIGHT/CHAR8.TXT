   Bob is an engineer. He loves his work and hates other people. He
   spends many happy hours tinkering with his drives and engines. Other
   people get in his way.
   
   Travil is good. He lets me work in peace with my engines. I'm glad he
   ordered the mission so I've got some time to fix things without
   interference.
   
   Grog is good too. He helps out lifting big things. He can't cook but
   that doesn't matter. Food is optional.
   
   The rest are pains who get in my way. Sherina is especially bad as she
   often pushes the ship too hard and damages things.

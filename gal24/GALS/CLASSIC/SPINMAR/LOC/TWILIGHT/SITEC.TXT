   This is the interesting one. A prison for psionic miscreants.
   Naturally, one of the players is psionic and they are mistaken for an
   inmate. Entering is not a problem, leaving is another matter. Any non
   psionics in the party are initially ignored, because upon entering
   they are believed to be the escort for the criminal(s). Once the
   escape is on, the first priority is to stun can recapture any psionic
   characters. Only after this has obviously dead ended will any interest
   be taken in the non psionics: they will be exterminated because they
   are assisting with the escape.
   
   The entryway to the prison is on the south side, a solid metal door
   two meters across and three meters tall. The metal is completely
   unknown and defies any analysis (as usual). The door also remains
   steadfastly closed, resisting any attempts to open it including the
   ATV firing with the pulse laser turret.
   
   Once the players are sufficiently stumped, the door will open and a
   highly advanced robot floats inside. The players are free to enter and
   the robot waits in the airlock until the psions have entered. Once
   inside the players have run of the installation except as noted in the
   location descriptions. The robots will be seen carrying out their
   routine patrols, ignoring the players. Roll 6 on 1D for a robot to be
   passing through a room when the players enter.
   
   Leaving is simple for the non-psions, however, they will not be
   permitted to return and re-enter without a psion with them. The psions
   are going to have to make a run for it. That's when the real fun
   starts.

   This one is a red herring. The neutrino burst detected came from a
   solar flare from the system's primary. The burst was detected through
   the planet (after all planets are pretty much transparent to
   neutrinos). Of course the players are only going to figure this one
   out if one of them, with navigation skill, checks up on their position
   relative to the local star when the bust was detected.
   
   It is very cold and dark on this side of the planet. This is a small
   flattened area, a little out of place in the surrounding mountainous
   terrain. The surface here is quite soft and spongy, being composed of
   a mixture of minute methane ice crystals and sand. There are some
   scattered rocks and a small methane ice lake nearby.
   
   The party's portable neutrino sensor will not detect anything abnormal
   because there is nothing to detect. A party member with surveying
   skill will be able to determine, after a few hours study, that the
   area is completely natural, a freak of nature. The methane lake is
   somewhere between 100m and 150m deep and frozen solid the entire way.
   The rocks are dull as always. About 2m below the surface of the sandy
   soil is solid bed rock.

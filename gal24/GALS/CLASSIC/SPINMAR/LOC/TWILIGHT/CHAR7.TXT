   Grog holds the record for the longest period of service without
   promotion. You were shipped onto this mission as the cook / general
   muscle man to get you some active duty. You cannot cook for nuts but
   you don't know it. At least you try to the best of your limited
   ability. You have picked up a liking for combat drugs and your UPP is
   really more like FFF116 (big strong and stupid). You have a child like
   innocence about you and you are eager to follow orders. You frequently
   make mistakes and this has been known to get you into trouble.
   
   Travil treats you really well, he doesn't ask you to do things you
   don't understand and he doesn't scream at you when you make mistakes.
   
   Sherina also treats you kindly and helps you out when you have
   problems.
   
   Bruce and Bob order you around too much, but Bruce at least explains
   things to you and doesn't scream when you stuff up. You don't think
   Bob likes you much.
   
   Grindle doesn't really speak to you. You figure he doesn't like you at
   all.
   
   Aryven does talk with you and he treats you kindly enough, but he does
   get upset with you when things go wrong.
   
   Hanit is always ordering you around and screaming at you and making
   speeches with lots of words you don't understand. You really don't
   like him.

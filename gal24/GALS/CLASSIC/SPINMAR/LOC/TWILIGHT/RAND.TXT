    -----------------
   
   There are seven different types of room in the base. The table below
   describes the purpose of each room, its size in meters and who is
   permitted to freely access the location. Naturally, the players are
   permitted to shoot their way into any room.
   
   Psionic are dampened throughout the entire base. Attempts to use them
   will produce no effects apart from a mild headache.

   Roll 9+ on 2D every five minutes for an encounter inside the base. If
   an encounter is called for, roll 1D on the following table using the
   encounter DM from the previous table. The base has a total of six
   scrubbots, twelve screwbots and six deathbots. Not all of the bots are
   necessarily in working order.

   The robots have been lifted from Traveller Adventure 2: Research
   Station Gamma with a few minor modifications. The main change made is
   that the Deathbot (security robot) has improved armour, it takes ten
   points of damage to generate a hit and it still acts as if protected
   by battledress. The deathbot laser can also damage the ATV on a roll
   of 12+ (which is an 8+ after skill modification), the deathbot will be
   damaged by a hit from the ATV lasers.
   
   The second change is in the screwbot's (animal handling robot's)
   weaponry: it now has an advanced stunner that requires a roll of
   endurance minus intellegence or less on 2D to avoid a thirty minus
   endurance minute stun (and a nasty headache for another hour or two
   afterwards). This stunner ignores all forms of personal armour (except
   black and white globes), treating all targets are having no armour for
   to hit purposes.
   
   If the GM thinks the robots are a little tough, it is recommended to
   introduce some equipment failure reducing the robot skills level,
   armour quality or weaponry. The exact modifications are left up to the
   individual GM.

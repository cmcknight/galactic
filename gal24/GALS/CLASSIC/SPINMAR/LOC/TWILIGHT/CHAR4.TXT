   You are a workaholic. You love your work. Your work is your life. You
   can spend hours looking at rocks. You frequently forget your orders
   when you come across a particularly impressive rock formation. You
   also have to do a top notch job. You are a perfectionist. You keep
   very much to yourself revelling in your work.
   
   You were orphaned when you were 10 when your parents were killed by
   some psionic bastard during the psi rebellion on your home world. This
   has made you somewhat moody, quite introverted and very hateful of any
   psionic (more than is usual for Imperials - lobotomy is too soft a
   punishment).
   
   Travil is a good commander, he expects you to do your job and he
   doesn't interfere.
   
   Hanit is a royal pain in the ass. He is always spouting off the we
   Solomani are the superior race bullshit. You don't want any of that
   crap, it only caused a major war last time it was popular. You also
   know that he is only seven eights Solomani blood (and have documents
   to prove it). You'll enjoy revealing this at an opportune moment.
   
   Grog is good. He is always willing to help you lug your heavy
   equipment around and he doesn't really get in the way.
   
   Aryven talks too much and he irritates you.
   
   The others haven't said much to you and you like it that way. You
   figure they are alright if this continues.

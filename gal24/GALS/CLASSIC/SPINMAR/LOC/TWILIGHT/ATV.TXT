  -----------
   
   The ATV with extended range fuel bladder has a total of 600 energy
   points, these are augmented by the on board solar cells. The ATV
   energy consumption per hour is:

Terrain    Movement    Life Support    Total
Plain         1            1            2
Rough         1            1            2
Mountain      2            1            3
   
   Then there is an additional life support cost based upon the
   temperature zone. Also based upon the zone, is the amount of energy
   the solar panels are capable of providing. Again these values are per
   hour and it should be remembered that the solar power generation
   cannot recharge the fuel supply, it can only be used to offset fuel
   consumption.

   ATV weapons fire should be handled exactly as in Across the Bright
   Face/Mission of Mithril with the modification that the solar cells
   cannot supply any of the power for weapons fire.

      ------
   
   This is the entryway to the rest of the complex. There are doors on
   the players' left, ahead and the airlock behind (remember no compass
   directions on this planet). All three doors are heavily re-enforced.
   There is a screwbot here on duty at all times (exception: it does go
   into the air lock when the players arrive before the outer door
   opens). The bot will hover in position doing nothing except as noted
   below.
   
   Access to the left door is permitted by all at any time, although
   psions have to make a dexterity check on 2D to come back through
   without the door closing in their faces. The screwbot will attempt to
   stun any psion who tries to go through the forward door, after
   stunning the bot will carry the offender to one of the cells. Access
   through the airlock is unrestricted.

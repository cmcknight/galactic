      ------

   This location is the control centre of the entire complex. One fully
   functional deathbot stands guard just inside the entrance and it will
   attempt to stop anybody from entering. The deathbot will not attack
   the players until they actually enter the room.
   
   There is lots of complex industrial machinery here providing the base
   with, for example: light, food, water, air, temperature control, cell
   waste disposal, cell gravity fields, recreation area holographic
   projector and door controls. These machines are relatively easy to
   turn on and off (i.e. big easy to use switches). Nothing that looks
   even remotely like either a power supply or a central control computer
   can be seen.

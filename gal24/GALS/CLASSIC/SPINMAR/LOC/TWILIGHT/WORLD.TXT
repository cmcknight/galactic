
  The World
  ---------
   
   The world 871-438 isn't the most exciting place in the universe. The
   only interesting feature of this dust ball is the list of things this
   world doesn't have:
     * No atmosphere.
     * No magnetic field.
     * No moons or other orbiting bodies.
     * Minimal hydrosphere in the form of various ices on the dark face.
     * No natural resources of any merit.
     * No tectonic activity.
     * No meteor craters.
     * No detectable life.
   
   In reality 871-438 does have a few redeeming features:
     * Tidally locked.
     * Extensive low level volcanic activity.
     * Lots of open flat space to land a crippled ship.
     * An aggressive carnivorous xenomorph with acidic blood.
   
   Three anomalous sites exhibit these aberrations:
   
    Site A
   
   The active EMS scan of this area produced a feint echo. Normally this
   would be of no concern being written off as sensor mis-alignment,
   transient electrical glitch or one of a dozen other alternatives.
   There is one hassle with writing this one off so easily, the echoes
   are identical to the original signal in every way despite the local
   geomorphology discouraging any systematic reflectivity - an unlikely
   yet theoretically possible event. There was insufficient time and
   motivation to go back and repeat the scans.
   
    Site B
   
   This site showed up as a bright spot on the ship's neutrino sensor.
   This could indicate a high energy source of some description. Then
   again it could be one of those infamous sensor glitches.
   
    Site C
   
   The densotometer reading exhibited a very high peak when scanning this
   region. This reading would usually indicate an area of increased
   density; for example heavy metals, super dense materials or especially
   dense metamorphic rock. Given the state of the rest of this dump, the
   last of these options seems likely.

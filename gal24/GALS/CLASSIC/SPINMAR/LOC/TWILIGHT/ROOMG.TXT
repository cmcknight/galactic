      ------

   Central control is hidden behind a concealed panel near the roof of
   the control centre. This location contains more machinery.
   Specifically, the computer brain of the complex, the psionics
   disruptor, the matter-antimatter powerplant and the planetary defences
   are all located here. The destruction, disabling or turning off of
   these devices is relatively simple once the room has been found. The
   difficulty of locating this room is the major challenge for the
   players.

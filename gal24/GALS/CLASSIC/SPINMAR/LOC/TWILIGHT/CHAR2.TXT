   Sherina is a Vargr female in heat. The mission wasn't supposed to last
   this long and you expected to be surrounded by a couple of dozen pack
   mates by this time. You are irritable, quick to anger, moody and sex
   starved. Have fun! You are also a great pilot with lightning
   reactions.
   
   Travil is a good commander with great charisma and he deserves deep
   respect. His orders are considered in the best possible light but they
   will not be followed blindly.
   
   Grog is respected for his great physical prowess and his huge size. If
   only he were slightly more hairy. Although he signed on as cook, he is
   very bad at it which is good because real Vargr don't cook and live
   meat tastes better.
   
   Bruce seems to posses enormous charisma which he doesn't use. He also
   smells slightly different to the other humans. You kind of like him.
   
   Grindle and Bob keep away from you and that is fine. They cannot
   shoot, fly or lead so they are not important.
   
   Aryven seems to take great pleasure in baiting you and you often have
   long, energetic and sometimes (playfully) violent conversations. He is
   fun to have around and you don't mind chattering with him.
   
   Hanit is a lost cause and you despise him. He treats you like an idiot
   and rates you at about the same developmental level as a slug. You
   violently detest when he tells you to heel along like Killer, his pet
   back home (if he does that one more time...). You take great pleasure
   in making his life miserable. He also smells weird.

   The ship's air raft has been replaced by an ATV. The ATV is fitted
   with an externally mounted long range fuel bladder and it also mounts
   a solar panel based power backup. The ATV is capable of unlimited
   endurance provided a light source is maintained. The ATV's life
   support system is capable of continuous operation for a minimum of
   least six weeks. The ATV mounts a single pulse laser turret, power for
   the turret can only be provided by the on board fusion power plant.
   
   The Asp's GSbAG Model 317 Pressurised Shelter has already been gutted
   by Bob to provide limited life support to the engineering sections of
   the Asp while he makes the necessary emergency repairs to the power
   plant and jump drive.

      ------
   
   This is the robot maintance room and hospital. This location contains
   one docbot, four deathbots, ten screwbots and four scrubbots. All of
   these bots, except for the docbot, are suhtdown. The room contains
   several large work benches and lots of shelves (mostly empty). Several
   of the bots are in various states of dismemberment.
   
   The docbot is a large cyclinder with lots of arms with a myrad of
   different tools: drills, saws, knives, syringes, etc. Once a player
   enters the room: it will hover toward the sick and injured; attempt to
   grab them one by one; scan each one after grabbing (bright light
   travels down their body) and repair any damage (insert large syringes
   full of ominous glowing chemicals). The whole capture and heal process
   takes from 15 to 20 seconds. Sickness and injury include any damage
   taken and Grog's combat drug addiction. The attempt to grab can be
   resisted by making a check against dexterity on 3D, and the grab can
   be broken by checking against strength on 3D.
   
   Of course, once the player's have broken into one of the restricted
   areas and gotten themselves onto the base's black list, the docbot
   will no longer heal them. Rather, it will float around ignoring them.

WINDSOR C783511-9                  Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     Population: 200,000 (5% independent rancher, 5% independent farm-
ers,  2%  independent fishermen, 65% Windsor Agrocorp  employees,  23% 
Akian immigrants)

     Windsor  is  a colony world currently under development,  and  is 
wholly  owned by the Windsor Agrocorp.  WA is owned by ConTech  (50%), 
LSP  (30%),  SIE (10%), general public (7%), and the Bank  of  Glisten 
(3%).   The  Akian immigrant population is tending to cluster  in  the 
three cities at present, in distinct contrast to the remainder of  the 
population.  There is some friction between Akians and the others, but 
it  has remained subdued.  The colonization fee for Windsor is  fairly 
high (Cr30,000 with discounts available for needed skills), so most of 
the  immigrants  were at least middle class to start  with.   The  Aki 
government  has proposed to subsidize emigration to Windsor, but  this 
proposal received strenuous protests from the WA Board of Directors at 
the 1110 annual meeting.

  A0.Intro
  
                            LUNION SUBSECTOR 1083 
                                       
   This scenario is intended for game conventions. It should be played
   with the predefined characters. It takes place in the Spinward
   Marches, subsector K - Lunion, not far from the border worlds. Date:
   1083.
   
   The scenario involves three crew and three passengers of the Windfall
   (a 40 year old, 200 ton Jayhawk far trader). Various encounters and
   trading opportunites will lead them to Ianic where they may get
   involved in the first Jonkeereen rebellion. See "The Regency
   Sourcebook".
   
   The scenario can unfold in several different ways as each character
   has his or her own goals. A lot of groups will not get to Ianic in the
   4-6 hours of normal convention scenarios but they should at least
   arrive on Sharrip.
   
   Six players are required: 3 for the crew and 3 for the passengers.
   Establish how old the players are and assign them appropriate
   characters. Ten minutes will be needed for each of them for the
   briefing, the character description and the rules.
   
   Each PC should choose a name and fill in the right hand side of the
   character sheet with what they want to take on the trip.
   
   The bounty hunter has an Imperial Licence for a laser pistol and, of
   course, has his own weapon. The captain could have weapons in the
   ship's locker and should decide what freight is being carried. Inform
   the captain that taking fertilisers to Ianic will bring 2kCr per
   displacement ton due to handling. Inform the stowaway passenger to
   hide as long as she wants.
   
   You also need 2 tables, they should stand side by side, one for the
   passengers and one for the crew. So if a crew member (e.g. the stuard)
   wants to enter the passenger staterooms she should change the table,
   and vice versa.
   
   Start the scenario with the crew on board, and the passengers
   arriving. Two scenes give the crew an opportunity to learn about ship
   combat rules. The first is a fat trader on a collision course. The
   second is a meteor storm while the referee should fake the wear value
   role of the thusters. You should make all sensor rolls uncertain to
   make this interesting.
   
   The *main* fight will be at Ianic against a Fast Courier. The Ine
   Givar psionic will befuddle the sensor crew for two rounds (one hour)
   to make such a David and Goliath battle possible.
   
   At Ianic the players need to arrive on the planet quickly as there is
   also a Cruiser in the system. The Jonkeereen will hide the Windfall
   underground so the players can help their revolution. (Double
   Adventure 6: Night of Conquest can be used for this.) They will also
   have to refuel at one of the gas giants and certainly have to leave
   the Imperium.

        Strouden      2327 A745988-D  N Hi In              920 Im

   Strouden in one of the main worlds of the Lunion subsector, and has an
   excellent starport. Ling Standard Products is building tech level 13
   warships near the frontier with the border worlds. The fast industrial
   growth caused an environmental disaster, so the atmosphere is now
   tainted and life is expensive here.

        Sensors/Average : 1000T freighter - trade - arriving
        Astrogation/Average : he is on a collision course

   As you leave Strouden, you see a 1000dt freighter crossing your
   intended course, you have to change course and recalculate jump. If
   you communicate with them, they won't answer.

        Arival:
        Sensors/Diffcult : Free Trader - Trade and Transport - to Capton

   You see a 200t ship very far away leaving the system.
   
   Sharrip belongs to the Al Morrib Line. Nobody lives on the surface as
   a deadly virus exists on the planet. The planet has an obital starport
   with a small crew of 50 people. Four of the crew are happy to be
   leaving for a vacation on Strouden, the rest start unpacking brand new
   equipment.

        Departure :
        Ship.Eng/Easy: The thrusters get hot and need repair
        Sensors/Easy: One big meteor crossing flightpath
        Astrogation/Difficult: the metror will be 2 kms away
        Sensors/Difficult: it's not just one big one - its lots and
                lots of little ones!

   The referee should manage to fake the wear value roll of the thrusters
   so the ship can not maneuver. PCs will need to destroy the meteors.
   You should start your clock running and remember that lasers recycle
   every three minutes. You should roll 2d6 for the number of small
   meteors that are *really* on a collision course. Any of them need a
   difficult sensor roll to lock on to in the first 15 minutes and an
   average roll in the last 6 minutes. Every meteor has a 10% chance of
   actually hitting the ship in a random location. (Thus, the situation
   is not as dangerous as it should seem to the players). Ensure that all
   sensor rolls are uncertain, e.g. by asking whether it is even or odd
   and rolling a hidden die. There should be only one sensor attempt per
   minute, leaving the players with a feeling of uncertainty,
   helplessness and fear.

                 Patrol Cruiser                      orbiting

   Lunion is the capital of subsector K of the Spinward Marches. Ling
   Standard is also building warships here. Like Strouden, Lunion has a
   tainted atmosphere because of an environmental disaster. Two ships are
   orbiting and two others are arriving. The captain will need to use
   communications and admin skills to avoid long orbit times.
   
   A lot of people on Lunion are talking about the civil war at Ianic,
   that Ianic has been declared a red zone and that it is forbidden to
   land there.
   
   The (illegal) freight to Ianic is quite normal, but the passengers are
   not. They are Ine Givar trying to help the Jonkeereen rebellion with
   their psionic skills.
   
   Departure : If they plot a course to Ianic the patrol cruiser will
   follow, so they have to make a dangerous jump from 10 diameters.

                          Two fighters - patrol      from AS2 to GG3
                          Cruiser      - refuelling  orbiting GG3

   Ianic has a normal atmosphere, but no water. Normally the water is
   shipped by a modular cutter from the asteroid belts. The warships have
   recently shot these down and are now blocking the planet's downport in
   the hope that the Jonkeereen capitulate. The cargo bay full of water
   and fertiliser (which are really nuclear pumped x-ray warheads for
   planetary defence missiles), would certainly make the war more
   interesting.
   
   If they manage to break the blockade, (one of the Ine Givar will
   befuddle the sensor crew of the Fast Courier) the PCs will be heroes,
   but they will have to leave the Imperium.
   
   Probably 1822, 1721, 1522 is their best route to the border worlds.

   Two weeks ago you purchased the Windfall. As it is known that a
   Jayhawk will not operate on the usual 1kCr per displacement ton, you
   are searching for a good trade route and found Ianic, a
   non-industrial, rich, desert planet with a population of nearly 9
   million. Water will fetch a price of 10kCr per ton. So it would be
   possible to pay for the Windfall (57 dt cargo hold) in just a few
   months.

   To keep your finances in the black, you hare hoping for passengers and
   have refitted the staterooms and the bridge section.
   
   You were lucky with the crew. As a stewardess you hired a medical
   school graduate. She is young and agreed to a crew salary. The chief
   is an old hand, took a quick look at the ship and said: "OK, I'll get
   this beast flying."

   You have been hired on whilst on Strouden and are happy that the
   captain only asked about technical things. He seems to be a bit green.
   The Windfall is not a wreck but it's not far off one. The power plant
   has a wear value of at least 4 and the thrusters, jump drive and
   contra-grav are not looking much better. The bridge section and
   passenger staterooms were refitted recently, but the rest of the 40
   year old Jayhawk needs a lot of rust chipping.

   Strouden is a nasty planet. Ling Standard is building ships here and
   caused an environmental disaster. Now 9 million people are suffering
   as a result. Leaving has been your dream for as long as you can
   remember. You went to school and have now been hired on as crew on a
   far trader. The captain is the same age as you but comes from a noble
   family. You have caught a glimpse of the chief engineer, a man in his
   mid-thirties who looks very tough.

   Anyway, things being what they were there wasn't much work for a
   ex-Marine Colonel who had seen lots of action to do.
   
   You visited the office of a local bank and did some discreet
   inquiries. Yes, they said, they paid 0.75% of the principal on the
   loan for ships recovered. Yes, we keep lists of skipped ships with
   holographs of their skippers... Oh.. but you need to have a private
   investigator's license.
   
   Of course you had one, so now you've got the list of skipped ships.
   You've heard rumours that a well known pirate has recently hired on
   the Windfall, a 40 year old Jayhawk, and you think this would be worth
   investigating. It would be interesting to compare the serial numbers
   of some of the more expensive items such as the power plant, jump
   drive, thrusters, contra-grav, computers and weapons.

   The *Disciples of the Bright Way* are a sect that believe their deity
   exists in jumpspace, and communicates directly with people while they
   are in jump. They call the sight of J-space *The Face of the Deity*
   and have a secret combination of drugs and meditation practices that
   reduce (but not eliminate!) the insanity impact of viewing J-space.
   
   They are generally not dangerous, but their disturbing practice of
   shooting up drugs and staring out of an open porthole into J-space
   during the week of a jump means that most captains will refuse to
   allow them on board under *any* circumstances.
   
   However, the Disciples will pay an *obscene* amount of money for
   passage on a ship, and since they don't care about bodily comforts
   they are quite happy to bunk two to a stateroom under middle passage
   conditions, and pay up to Cr25,000 each for their 'pilgrimage'.
   
   You are a noble count so you don't need to worry about money. You
   haven't asked the captain yet to be allowed a place in front of the
   porthole in the air lock.

   You have run away from home, ended up at the downport and hidden
   inside a container going to Lunion. You have heard that the ship will
   go to Ianic - a desert planet populated by Jonkeereen.
   
   " Deneb 1324 Jonkeer : The inhabitants of the world, the Jonkeereen
   are geneered humans, created by Imperial Ministery of Colonization of
   Desert Environments.
   
   Jonkeereen are tall, thin and dark skinned, with protective membrans
   shielding thier eyes and ears. More important than these cosmetic
   differences are sophisticated changes to their metabolism that allow
   them to survive in the temperature extremes of the dry desert
   environment.

     The  planet  is split between four main governments  and  several 
minor ones.  The populations cluster around the sea shores, and  there 
are vast tracts of desert in the hinterlands.  One government is being 
supported  by Kwai Ching, and is presently gaining ascendancy  despite 
an  alliance by the other three powers due to the importation of  TL10 
weaponry.  Some local production of TL7 weapons is being undertaken by 
this state, and the presence of Kwai Ching advisors is commonplace.

TSARINA  D120636-5                 Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     Colonized in 697 from Glisten for exploitation of platinum  group 
metals.  The ownership of the mining company came to be controlled  by 
three  families  by  726, and has remained so since.   The  colony  is 
totally dependent on imports of food and equipment--equipment of up to 
TL9  is  used, but there is no repair capability.   The  situation  is 
becoming unstable at present as Glisten social activists are  engaging 
in  a  propaganda campaign among the mineworkers.  The  workers  them-
selves  suffer  from  prolonged breeding among too  small  a  breeding 
stock, and have an substantially subnormal average IQ.  They are  also 
extremely  superstitious,  and view the three families  as  ruling  by 
divine right, which has led to limited success thus far for the  Glis-
ten social activists.  "Stupid as a Tsarina miner" is a common turn of 
phrase in the subsector.
     Imports: Food, Parts, Heavy Equipment
     Exports: Platinum group metals
     Restrictions:  Books,  tapes, and other data media  are  severely

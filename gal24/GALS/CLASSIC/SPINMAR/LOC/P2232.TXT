     Crout is very overpopulated for its size and current tech  level.  
In addition, the outlook of its inhabitants borders on the xenophobic.  
All  of  this leads to a very high-pressure  and  unstable  situation.  
Many  starship  captains would be reluctant to land here even  if  the 
port  facilities were better because of the resentment of the  inhabi-
tants toward anyone perceived as being better off.
     The  current  planetary administration has been  in  power  since 
1031,  and  is based on the annual election of four co-rulers  from  a 
very limited pool of candidates.  While public opinion remains suppor-
tive of the regime, sociological analysts predict that the  repressive 
measures  recently enacted will precipitate a civil war within ten  to 
fifteen years.
     Crout is very technologically backwards; the only area of unusual 
expertise is in environmental control--greenhouses supply all food and 
most  of the breathing air.  Recycle of biomass provides  methane  for 
supplementary heating and power.  There is a very strong cultural bias 
toward  self-sufficiency,  so that each family should  be  capable  of 
growing its own food, repairing its own house, and so on.  Communities 
tend to center around glassworks, with self-sufficiency in this  vital 
area being judged on the community level.

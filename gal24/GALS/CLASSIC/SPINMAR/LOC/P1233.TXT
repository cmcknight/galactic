FLEXOS  E5A1422-6                  Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     The  atmosphere of this planet is carbon dioxide/nitrogen,  which 
allows  basic  plants to be used as atmosphere  converters  in  green-
houses.  The inhabitants are all descendants of the 14 passengers  and 
crewmembers  of  a  starship which misjumped about 650,  and  was  not 
discovered  for  approximately  80 years.   Extensive  inbreeding  has 
caused  a good deal of genetic drift/damage.  The current  inhabitants 
are  all very uniform in appearance, bald, albino, and  six  fingered.  
They  have little desire to breed outside the group (and vice  versa!) 
and  the population is declining.  The ship is still  partially  func-
tional at the core of the inhabited area.

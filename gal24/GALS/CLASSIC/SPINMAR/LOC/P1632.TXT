     Originally  a Forine penal colony, settled around  750.   Contact 
ceased  some 40 years later, when the lanthanum mines were  exhausted.  
The present colony consists of descendants of the original  prisoners, 
in  a number of underground cities.  The planet is fairly self  suffi-
cient,  although  97% of the food supply consists  of  cultured  yeast 
products.  As a result, natural food is in high demand, and there  are 
no import duties on it.  The government assesses a 1% transaction  tax 
on all other activities by offworld merchants.

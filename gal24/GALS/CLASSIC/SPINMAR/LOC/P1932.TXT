MITHRAS  C8B5546-6                 Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

Imperial  Prison.   Not really too bad a place, Mithracity  is  under-
ground  and the guards do little but keeps brawls down to  a  minimum.  
The  planet is a killer, and cooperation is expected of and  respected 
by the inhabitants.  No outgoing emigration.

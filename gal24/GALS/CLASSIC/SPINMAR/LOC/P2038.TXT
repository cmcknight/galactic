     Mostly  a waterworld-the land is concentrated in  one  continent.  
The  population of 70,000 is scattered across this continent in  small 
holdings.  There is a heavy reliance on orbital communications for the 
planetary datanet.  There is a well developed medical response system, 
paid for by subscription of over 95% of the population.  It is consid-
ered good manners when on Trane to offer a contribution for the  medi-
cal  service.  The primary exports are exotic organics harvested  from 
the local fauna.  Water travel is primarily by submersible due to  the 
magnitude  of  inclement weather which can be experienced  with  large 
unbroken expanses of water.

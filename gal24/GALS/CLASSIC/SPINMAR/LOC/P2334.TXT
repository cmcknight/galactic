     Population: 940,000,000
     Tech Level in 1105: 8

     The planetary government concluded a treaty with Glisten in  1109 
for  major  technological assistance in return for a monopoly  on  the 
export  of radioactives.  The colony was founded from Glisten  in  726 
when  exploitable quantities of superheavy elements  were  discovered.  
The current bureaucratic administration is a direct descendent of  the 
Glisten  MinCol Department which was responsible for the planet  prior 
to  the declaration of independence in 877.  In the early  900's,  the 
population  was  almost completely converted to Khargin, a  stoic  and 
introspective  religion  of Vilani origin.  The  population  increased 
drastically  and the technological level fell off as more of the  pla-
net's  resources were turned to maintaining subsistence.  by the  time 
the treaty was signed in 1108, the tech level had fallen to 8, and the 
exploitation  of the resources that were the colony's initial  purpose 
had  long since ceased.  At present, offworld visitors are  restricted 
to  the vicinity of the starport, and the population is  closely  con-
trolled because of the scarcity of resources.
     Imports of food are duty free, and generally can be sold for  10-
30% over the expected value.  (20-40% if the trader is willing to take 
payment  in barter).  Exports are radioactives (restricted to  holders 
of Glisten MinTrade licenses) and heavy metals.

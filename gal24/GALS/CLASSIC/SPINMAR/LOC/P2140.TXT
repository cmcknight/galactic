     The  Imperial  Navy base provides the livelihood for  the  entire 
population  of this unpleasant little planet.  About half the  popula-
tion are dependents of Navy personnel, and the other half are  engaged 
in service activities catering to Navy, Scout and Merchant  personnel.  
Most  food  is imported, and food prices are quite  high  outside  the 
subsidized Navy commissary.
     No significant exports.
     The  ruler  of the planet is an Imperial nobleman, The  Baron  of 
Romar.   For  the last seventy years, this position has  been  in  the 
hands of the Garol family, and the current Baron is a former  Imperial 
Navy captain.

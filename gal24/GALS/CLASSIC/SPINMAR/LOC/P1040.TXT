     The  Lord Leader is currently supporting one of the rival  states 
on Singer, with the intention of securing his supply of lanthanum  and 
exotic alloying metals.  The world is industrializing, with an  empha-
sis at present on military hardware for export to Singer.  Some dissi-
dent group are not pleased with this trend.  Efforts are being made to 
upgrade the starport.  Kwai Ching has no ships due to the lack of jump 
grid metals, and is currently maintaining tenuous contact with  Singer 
by chartering two Type R merchants.

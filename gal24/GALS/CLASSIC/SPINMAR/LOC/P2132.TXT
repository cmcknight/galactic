     An  abandoned mining colony.  The remaining inhabitants  live  in 
the abandoned company buildings, hunt the upland forests, and come  to 
town  for  parts  to keep their respirators  running.   All  operating 
vehicles are left over from the mining operations.  There is little or 
no  contact with other worlds, except for a visit from the  occasional 
free trader.  Population is about 20,000.

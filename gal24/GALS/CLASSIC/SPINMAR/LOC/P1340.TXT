MOTMOS  B68468B-5                  Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     The  7,000,000 inhabitants of Motmos are scattered about  one  of 
the  two major land masses in small villages, linked by telephone  and 
telegraph.  There is only one city with a population of over  500,000, 
the  seaport  of New Bryton.  The planetary starport, located  at  New 
Bryton, is run under contract by the OutReach corporation of  Collace.  
The  main  export is foodstuffs, although there is some  gold  mining.  
Imports  are  subject to a 45% sales tax unless payment  is  taken  in 
local goods.  The government is fairly restrictive, and civil  service 
positions are almost always hereditary.

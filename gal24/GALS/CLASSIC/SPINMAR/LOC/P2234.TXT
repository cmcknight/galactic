     Inthe is a mining colony, fairly prosperous, under the  authority 
of the bureau for Extra-System affairs of the Tiremese Offworld Coali-
tion.  All inhabitants are residents of one city, Inthetown, (or  just 
'Town'),  and most are Offworld Citizens.  Town is clean, and the  air 
smells  normal, which is about all one can hope for in such  a  place.  
The  primary  export is copper, along with silver and  a  few  scarcer 
metals.   Town is self-sufficient in food due to application of  space 
habitat techniques.  A flotilla of four OC fleet escorts (7th  Flotil-
la, Watson, Egaron, Falmont, Garis) is based here permanently, and  at 
least one government bulk carrier is usually present.

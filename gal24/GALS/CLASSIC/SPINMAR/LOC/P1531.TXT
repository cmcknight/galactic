DAWNWORLD  E885000-0               Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     Dawnworld has remained uncolonized to the present due to a  clus-
ter  of  related  ecological factors.  On a  microlevel,  most  humans 
experience  an  allergic  reaction to common  Dawnworld  pollens.   In 
addition,  in some regions, airborne spores exist that will sprout  in 
human  lungs.  Most plants use L-rotary sugars and  are  nutritionally 
useless.   The fauna in the planet's current epoch runs  to  dinosaur-
like  creatures,  the largest of which pose a threat  to  humans  from 
sheer size.  In many of the smaller animal niches, cold blooded  crea-
tures  predominate,  allowing for a much higher  carnivore  population 
that  would otherwise be the case.  Perversely, while humans are  poi-
sonous to native creatures, they also smell tasty.
     There  is currently (1107) a small exploratory colonization  mis-
sion  from  Horosho established on a small island (10  by  20  miles), 
working  on  various ways of keeping the large fauna away  from  human 
habitations  in a way that won't cause more problems.  (Just  shooting 
them  and leaving the carcasses to rot doesn't work well because  many 
of  the  medium to large scavengers will also attack  live  prey--i.e. 
humans.)

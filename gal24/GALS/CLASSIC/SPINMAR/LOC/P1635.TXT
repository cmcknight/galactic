BINGES A800231-A                   Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     Binges was colonized from Glisten in 1057 by a group of  specula-
tors hoping to build the starport and cash in.  However, their  analy-
sis  of traffic in the region was faulty, and the port has  not  pros-
pered.   The  planet has the dubious distinction in  recent  years  of 
being a flag-of-convenience homeport to a large number of disreputable 
free  traders.   (Larger companies are not free enough  from  Imperial 
restrictions to avail themselves of this service.)
     During the Fifth Frontier War, the starport was opened to Collace 
fleets,  which nearly caused annexation of the planet after  the  war.  
However,  the owners of the port successfully appealed their  case  in 
the Imperial Court at Trin, arguing that they had little choice in the 
face of overwhelming force.  Despite the outcome of the case,  resent-
ment remains high among local Imperial officials at Glisten, and  more 
IGN ships than usual have been passing through the system.

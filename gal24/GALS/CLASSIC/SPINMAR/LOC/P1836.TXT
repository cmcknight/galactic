    Water  is  currency  on this extremely dry  world.   The  original 
colony  was founded here by a group of religious ascetics around  640.  
Very  little trace of the original religion remains  today--the  harsh 
climate  seemed to breed nothing but a host of prophets.  The  several 
main groups of nomads are very fierce, and extremely adept at the  use 
of  primitive weapons.  In the cities, the current religion  is  built 
around a cannibalistic cult with an emphasis on high fertility.   Both 
types  of cultures are highly ritualistic, and anyone interested  must 
study the ritual skill separately (defaults to Liaison minus 3).   Use 
the  level of ritual as a positive DM on reactions with natives.   The 
occasional  outsiders  who venture here are generally  safe  from  the 
local violence.  The Glisten PARS usually maintains a cutter here  (in 
orbit)  to  render  any necessary  assistance  in  space  emergencies.  
Refueling  capability in the entire system is virtually  non-existent, 
and  any ship visiting had better have fuel for the return  jump.   If 
you  try to use water to refuel on the planet, it costs  roughly  10cr 
per liter.

BENDOR  A756656-C                  Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     Bendor  is about as nice a place as you can imagine.  Except  for 
the thin atmosphere, the planet is extremely earth-like.  The  popula-
tion  is small, and the Marquis likes it that way.  No immigration  is 
permitted, but visitors are welcome.  Much of the planet's agricultur-
al  activity  is automated, with robotics mostly being  imported  from 
Glisten.  Bendor is a favorite vacation spot in the region, and hotels 
are  very common in a variety of settings from mountains to shore  and 
from temperate to tropical.  Since it is ruled directly by an Imperial 
noble,  cooperation  with the Navy base is good, and there  is  little 
friction.  Unusual exports include karakka nuts (native to the  planet 
and  impossible  to  cultivate in quantity elsewhere),  a  variety  of 
perfumes,  and a number of excellent wines with a lot of snob  appeal.  
These latter can be found for export occasionally (Formidable, Trader, 
1 day, success produces 3d6 bottles at 2d6*50 credits each).

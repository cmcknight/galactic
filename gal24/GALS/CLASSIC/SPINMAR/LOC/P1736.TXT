MELIOR D140466-7                   Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     Melior is a long-term terraforming project, being administered by 
the MinCol branch office on Egypt.  Large quantities of ice  asteroids 
are being diverted and used to bombard the planet.  Their impacts have 
all  been  precalculated to avoid inhabited areas, but  mistakes  have 
occurred  and  MinCol takes no responsibility for ships  landing  away 
from  the  scientific outpost.  There are no exports of  any  signifi-
cance.   This  phase of the terraforming project is  scheduled  to  be 
completed  in  1150, and has been underway since  1090.   MinCol  will 
contract for pusher ships on a freelance basis.

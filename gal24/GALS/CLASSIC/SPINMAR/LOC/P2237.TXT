     The scout base here is orbital.  The entire planetary  population 
is  transient,  hirelings of the ConTech military  training  facility.  
The  planetary flora and fauna are toxic to humans, and  all  previous 
attempts at colonization have failed when crops were overrun by  local 
pests.  The problem is not insoluble, but the economics of  terraform-
ing  have  not been favorable up to now.  ConTech has been  using  the 
planet  as  a training ground for mercenaries since  1072,  and  their 
facility is available for a reasonable fee.

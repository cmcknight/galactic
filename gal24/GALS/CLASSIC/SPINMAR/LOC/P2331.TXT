BICORNN  E563576-2                 Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     Settled in 390 by a group of Utopian idealists, the planet  pros-
pered for 500 years, although it divided into several nations.  Always 
isolated from the Imperial mainstream, a war was waged using  biologi-
cal  agents in 893, at which time the population was 877-8.   In  less 
than  a year, 95% of the planetary population died,  and  civilization 
disappeared.   Virulent diseases (to which the present  population  is 
immune)  remain active in the biosphere, which ensures that the  world 
continues  to be isolated.  No exports or travellers from Bicornn  are 
permitted to land on any other world in the region, and offworld visi-
tors are advised to remain in protective suits.

     Aster  is a potentially rich water world, which is  chartered  in 
its  entirety  to  the Aster Exploitation  Corporation.   Two  shallow 
seabed  cities  are presently under construction.  The  population  of 
about 40,000 is almost exclusively employed at this, although a number 
of scientific teams are scattered around the planet.

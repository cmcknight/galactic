MILLE FALCS  B9A2469-C             Rob Dean (robdean@access.digex.net)

     A  typical navy base planet.  The atmosphere is  almost  entirely 
nitrogen,  and  there is no life except for a few types  of  anaerobic 
bacteria, of interest only to scientists.  As a result the surface  is 
very  dusty,  and windstorms frequently make landing at  the  downside 
base  impossible.   The downside base consists of a number  of  buried 
domes.  The orbital facility is fairly extensive, and is interconnect-
ed with the civilian modules.

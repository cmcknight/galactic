
Antares Subsector
-----------------

Antares Subsector is home to the League of Antares, an autonomous polity
created as a result of the peace treaty of 191, formally ending the Julian
War.  The 12 worlds composing the League had been captured by the Julian
Protectorate, and several Antarean families who had been refugees from the
Pacification Campaigns were placed in power in this group of worlds.
Although nominally independent of the Imperium and sympathetic to the
Julian Protectorate, they nevertheless are deep within the Imperial sphere
of influence, and the only thing keeping the Imperium from reoccupying the
cluster is the certainty that the Julian Protectorate will react negatively
to a breach of the peace treaty.

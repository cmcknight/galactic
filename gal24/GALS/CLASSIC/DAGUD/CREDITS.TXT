   I began working on Dagudashaag in the early days of HIWG, and 
   published a number of articles in the HIWG database as Dagudashaag 
   Sector Developer. I joined up with Jae and Leighton Piper sometime 
   later (c. 1990), when I learned that they wanted to develop an entire 
   sector in their fanzine 'Signal GK' and thought that my articles 
   would be a reasonable start to work from. 

   The world data used in our development of Dagudashaag was nearly, but 
   not completely consistent with the official sector data we obtained 
   from GDW.... the UWPs of a few important worlds were changed. The 
   names of the worlds were created jointly by the members of the Signal 
   GK team.

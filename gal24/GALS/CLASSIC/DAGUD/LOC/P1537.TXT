An escaped gas giant satellite, tidally locked. Zalaana still occupies 
the same orbit as its parent planet Qh	. The bases are established in 
the Twilight zone where the temperatures are sufficiently warm to 
sustain life. The planet specialises in exporting the many exotic plant 
and animal life that live in the sunward and nightside.

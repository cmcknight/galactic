This colony was originally named Nokhopii, Vilani for "Beauty". The planet 
was truly full of natural beauty. Then the Vilani colony utterly vanished 
without trace. 10,000 men, women and children disappeared leaving behind an 
empty settlement. Everything organic in the camp had vanished. A second 
colony was established and it too vanished. This time it was able to 
pinpoint the disappearence to a three month period corresponding to the 
summer. The planet was considered jinxed. It was renamed No Hope and 
remained uncolonised until 756 when ICE established a small research 
station which was ordered to record everything. That summer the orbiting 
station witnessed the deaths of their team-mates on the surface as the 
summer heat brought a carnivorous worm to the surface of the planet in such 
abundance that the entire surface of the continent seemed to squirm. The 
colonists hadn't a chance. Subsequently orders were given to hunt down and 
totally exterminate these creatures and successful colonisation was finally 
achieved.

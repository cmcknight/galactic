A Bwap/Scanian colony, the planet is extremely rich in aquaculture. The 
Government is an adaptation of the Bwap model and is extremely 
frustrating for visiting humans. There is currently much debate as to 
the status of one of the local lifeforms, the seal-like Gaarkh. The 
creatures are extremely violent, possibly psychopathic, and all 
peaceful attempts to try and prevent their migrational, suicidal 
attacks on the cities have failed. A recent attack apparently showed 
the Gaarkh using primitive clubs for the first recorded time and the 
local Scanian Sanhedra wishes to call in the Scout service to re-
evaluate their status. This course has been rejected by the Bwap 
Government who appear willing to force the race into extinction.

REFEREE'S INFORMATION

The Gaarkh are not an intelligent species, merely tool using. Clubs are 
only used for hunting, not migration. (Those Gaarkh seen with clubs were 
on a hunt prior to attempting their seasonal migration, which leads 
them directly through the Scanian/Bwap cities.) Only the deep jungle 
hunters are aware that Gaarkh have always used clubs, but they have 
never felt the need to report it.

Cold, vacuum world which is subject to extreme daytime temperatures in 
excess off 220oc and nighttime temperatures of -250oc. The world was 
colonised by vacuum miners who discovered minute traces of Onnesium-118 
on the planet. The lucky few who discovered sufficiently large deposits 
became billionaires and built grav-palaces, the rest reside within deep 
underground cities dreaming of finding the mother lode. A social rank 
based on success determines privileges and responsibilities. Only 
successful miners can stand for governmental positions.

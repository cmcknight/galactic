Gas giant satellite, Sharaa was settled by Solomani late in the Long 
Night. The planet is primarily known for its active Solomani-
sympathies. The inhabitants are extremely xenophobic. After the planet 
was discovered to be a supply depot for Solomani terrorists during the 
Solomani Rim War (990-1002) the planet was placed under military 
control. The population still has extremely strong sympathies towards 
Solomani policy and are believed to be supporting the Red Eagles; a 
terrorist group until recently working within the sector.

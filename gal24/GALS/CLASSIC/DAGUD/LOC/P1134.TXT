The history of Adakhem is one of a rich Lanthanum strike back in the 
first Imperium. Then the Long Night struck and the miners found 
themselves stranded. Slowly they adapted to their new home and when the 
Argian's conquered them they had reverted to a tribal tech 1 culture. 
They were enslaved and brutally exploited. With the collapse of the 
Empire the Adakhemian's placed severe restrictions on visitors to the 
planet. It is only in the last 300 years that the deep lanthanum mines 
were rediscovered but the Adakhemian's refused to allow exploitation. 
Then all contact with Adakhem stopped and visitors to the planet 
discovered only dead bodies of the weak and elderly. Of the younger 
tribesmen nothing is known. The current theory is that the original 
settlers had been dying out due to inbreeding and the younger tribesmen 
decided to journey into the mountain regions to search for other tribes. 
Extensive searches have revealed no clues and within the last hundred 
years the planet has been sold to SUSAG who are currently stripmining 
the lanthanum.

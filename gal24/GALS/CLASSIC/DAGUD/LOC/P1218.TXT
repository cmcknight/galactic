Lasiimshim is notable for being the birthplace of Grand Admiral Ramon 
Harosaka, better known as Ramon II, one of the Barrack Emperors during the 
Civil War. Among the places of interest on the planet are the Sky-Dragon 
reserves and Imperial War Museum. The centrepiece of the museum is Ramon's 
flagship, the "Avenging Destiny", one of the few warships left from the Civil 
war period. Other important displays include a holographic recreation of the 
Second battle of Ushra where Ramon was killed, and the Pacification Campaigns 
Centre, dedicated to the period when Dagudashaag was integrated into the 
young Third Imperium. It should be noted that tourism is the planet's main 
source of income and Ramon's story of meteoric rise from rags to riches its 
only claim to fame.

Khemelov is a world in ruins. Until 1014 it was a highly populated industrial
world. However, a massive solar flare from Kossilov, its primary, led to the
death of over 80% of the population. Most of the survivors were evacuated
soon after.

A small, determined, minority remained. They have taken quite extreme methods
of increasing the population. In addition to attempting to attract new
colonists through financial enticements, the planetary council has decreed
that all must undergo forced cloning and have made it illegal not to clone.
They are also experimenting with increasing the fertility of young adults. As
a result, twins and triplets are a common sight on the surface.

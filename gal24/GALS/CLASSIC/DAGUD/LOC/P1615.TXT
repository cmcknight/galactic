Kikaduum is famed for its gas trade. Large underground caverns are filled
with a multitude of exotic gases found naturally nowhere else. Unfortunately 
this has meant that the surface of the planet can be extremely volatile and
sudden and violent explosions the norm. This has meant that the colonists 
must live on a gigantic sky-city held aloft by grav generators. Mining is 
also done by means of grav-powered platforms which float above the sites 
extracting and refining the gases.

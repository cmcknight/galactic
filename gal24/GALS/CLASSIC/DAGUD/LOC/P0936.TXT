A cold, dismal world with a mean surface temperature of -74oc and a 
gravity of 0.69g. Some heat is provided by the several active volcanoes 
in the habitable zone and is primarily a mined-out world. Abbayi is 
unique in that it has a settlement of several religions including 
the Scanian's, Vargr Church of the Chosen Ones, The Church of the 
Stellar Divinity and the Khaarkhi Cult who have established a centre 
for religious discussion on the planet.

REFEREE'S INFORMATION

In 799 the Scanian's established a secret Psionics Institute on the 
planet which has continued its training up to the present day. Only 
unadapted Scanian's and Sanhedra Rab'ani who would not be missed are 
tested and sent. Once trained they return to their communities and 
teach the chosen how to become Sanheichiir.

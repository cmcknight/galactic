Home world of The Scanian Culture and the Aquan adaptation. Famous for 
the Scanian ability to read body language and Scanian culinary arts. 
Akiva is a water world renowned for its fierce beauty. The planet 
suffered a great deal of persecution during the Psionic repressions due 
to its open teaching of psionic abilities and its political ties to the 
Zhodani. The psionic teachings were completely eradicated from the 
Scanian culture and in 1021 were welcomed back into the Imperium.

Prosperous colony during the First Imperium and Long Night the 
population began to die of a mysterious plague in 366 which caused its 
suffers to severely mutate. The planet was successfully quarantined. It 
was eventually discovered that victims removed from the planet stopped 
mutating (though they were unable to be cured) and no longer appeared 
to be carriers of the plague. In 369 the decision was made to totally 
evacuate the planet. Scientists are still unable to find a reason for 
the Lumnuan plague though it would appear to be still active on the 
surface. Today, various salvage companies risk the surface in full body 
armour salvaging items from the old cities. A small trade port, known 
as "Death and Glory", is the only permanent population on the surface.

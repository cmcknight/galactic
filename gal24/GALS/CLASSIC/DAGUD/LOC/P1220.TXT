The Katris system would be largely uninteresting were it not for the fact 
that a huge space battle occurred here during the Interstellar Wars era. The 
battle was fought on the edge of the system, close to the star's Oort cloud.

Although no-one has been able to actually locate the site, lumps of wreckage 
and even whole sections of ships occationally tumble into the system, taking 
up a cometary orbit around the star. These are worth a fortune on the 
collector's market and are highly prized by historians and archaeologists.
Oddly, all the wreckage recovered so far has been Vilani.

REFEREES ONLY:

Much of the wreckage has been so badly damaged that it has been impossible
to actually state which race it belonged to. In addition, Solomani
wreckage brings a much higher price on the black market and so, the more 
recognisable pieces have failed to find their way into public view having 
been sold privately.

The world consists of a single continent, a jungle consisting mainly 
of fungus and lichen cover most of the landmass. The spores released 
by the massive jungles of fungus render the air unbreathable for two 
months a year and can lodge in a person's lungs growing inside, slowly 
suffocating the carrier. Due to the dangers involved only indentured 
personnel actually stay on the planet. The Companies maintain bases to 
search for and gather various fungus but in particular the spores 
known as Golden Spores which can restore vitality and health to the 
human organism.

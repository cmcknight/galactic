Adele  is one of the  important agricultural  exporters of Ushra.
The most  productive areas are the  temperate latitudes: inbetween the
large desert equatorial regions and the transient polar ice-caps.

Another  potentially  rich  agricultural  world  lies  deep within the
Adele system.  Miagrathe orbits at 0.4  AUs around the tight  pair of
M-class stars that are the far  companions of the central star, Agran.
Miagrathe (Y556000-0)  has yet to be  extensively surveyed despite the
attentions of  the IISS looking for  suitable worlds with colonisation
potential. Recent  speculation that Sternmetal have  made overtures to
the  subsector government  for the  purchase of  Miagrathe has  sent a
number of hopefuls off to the planet in search of valuable ores.

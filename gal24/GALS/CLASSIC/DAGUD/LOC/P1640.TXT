Lenashuuk is a hostile world - the tidal influence of a large moon 
causes severe seismic disturbances. The surface of Lenashuuk is 
covered with oceans of liquid sulphur, and the atmosphere is composed 
of nitrogen, sulphur dioxide, and various hydrocarbons, forcing the 
population to live in large, domed habitats.

The history of Lenashuuk has been one of armed strife. The world was 
originally settled by several rival mining companies, intent on 
exploiting the world's immense reserves of titanium and molybdenum. 
Territorial disputes over mining rights and transportation routes have 
periodically erupted into full-scale warfare. The culture of Lenashuuk 
seems not to be able to understand the concept of compromise.

Sector Duke Raegis Viisarikaa IV was killed on Lenashuuk in 1114, when 
the accidental firing of a mass-driver artillery weapon ruptured the 
pressurised habitat he was visiting, during a visit intended to bring 
peace to the troubled world.

REFEREE'S INFORMATION

Sector Duke Raegis Viisarikaa IV was assassinated by agents of Archduke 
Dulinor of Llelesh, who wished to destabilise the Sector in preparation 
for his bid for the Imperial throne. Karyn Viisarikaa is unaware of 
this fact.

Iash is a small tidally-locked moon of the large gas giant Guvaahm. Initial
explorations indicated a rich deposit of Lanthenum. This turned out to be a
cruel hoax for the thousands of prospectors who flocked to the system eager
to make their fortunes and in the end lost all they had in trying to support
their operations. This incident has worked its way into a local saying which
is added to the end of sentences where the speaker is expressing disbelief at
another's statement: "..and there's more substance in an Iashan strike!"

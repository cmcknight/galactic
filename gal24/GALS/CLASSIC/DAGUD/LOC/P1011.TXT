As a result of being originally colonised by Aquans, all cities have been
built beneath the sea and the planet specialises in pisciculture. Today a
large percentage of the population is Vargr and the surface of the planet is
an untouched wilderness with even the starport being established on a
floating artificial island rather than build on land. Safari's into the
archaepelago's often bring back new undiscovered species even to this day.


Station Two 2327 C160004-B   Lo Ni De  202  Im M4 V

One of a chain of ten stations established on desolate planets throughout
the sector at the time of the initial Third Imperium infiltration. They were
intended to monitor potential trouble spots such as the Pact. They were
discontinued in 342 and most of the bases were renamed and handed over to the
IISS. Station Two was considered relatively useless and the base was simply
stripped. The port is maintained as an near-automatic facility serviced by
personnel from MMSL.

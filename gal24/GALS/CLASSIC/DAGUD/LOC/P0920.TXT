Congress is a hermitage world which is run both as a religious seminary and a 
retreat by the Church of the Brethren. The Tech level is deliberately kept 
down and large areas of the planet are left as wilderness to allow Church 
leaders and students to commune with nature. A small team of caretaker monks 
are the only permanent inhabitants.

The remarkable thing is that Congress had been a major industrial planet 
until 653 when, its natural resources exhausted the major stockholder, IPP,
pulled out. The Church bought the planet for a pittance and proceeded to
terraform it into the paradise it is today.

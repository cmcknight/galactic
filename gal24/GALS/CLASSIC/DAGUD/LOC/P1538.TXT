Originally established as a penal planet, the descendants have adapted 
to the extremely high oxygen content and have gone on to establish 
various colonies throughout the sector. In -603 the planet was 
quarantined after a large segment of the population began to exhibit 
advanced stages of psychopathic behaviour. This was subsequently 
discovered to be the result of a plant spore which fills the air for a 
period of about ten days every local year. The cities are now 
established beneath vast sealed units with blowers at each entrance to 
prevent the spores from entering the cities. The planet is no longer 
used as a penal settlement and the spore is used in the manufacture of 
combat drugs. The planet has Amber status during the spore season and 
visitors are reminded of the non-existent law level and potential 
dangers involved in visiting the planet.

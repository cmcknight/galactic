Nguma  is  a  large  unusual  world  which  exhibits  a  large orbital
eccentricity  due to  the gravitational  effect of  the central star's
companion. The dense  atmosphere is ellipsoid with a  variation of two
atmospheres  between the  less dense  polar regions  and the  equator.
There is free-standing  water only in the higher  latitudes during the
'winter' or the  high altitudes of the polar  regions during the short
but intense summers. Much of the equatorial regions remain unexplored.

This inhospitable  world has become  an important juncture  with ships
passing into the heart of  Ushra from Arnakhish subsector only because
of the medically hostile nature of Lemuria. The class A starport is an
orbital facility with a subsidiary class C port on the surface.

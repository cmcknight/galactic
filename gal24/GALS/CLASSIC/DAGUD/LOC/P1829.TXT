Pr'Geehr is a small, cool world (average global temperature -9 C) with a
dense atmosphere. The initial surveys conducted by early Vilani explorers
missed the planets indigenous minor race the Geehrtahe.
The planet itself had little in the way of resources to offer investors and
the low gravity discouraged colonisation. Pr'Geehr was regarded as a pretty,
little world unlikely to account for much. That was until the discovery of
the Geehrtahe. All visitors are subject to a full quarantine prior to landing
and are limited to visiting the human settlement of Handsoff.

Despite its ideal conditions, Elysium has only two minor settlements. The
planet is ruled over by a constitutional monarch, King Raoul III, and is a
major meat exporter throughout the subsector.

In recent years there has been several major disturbances concerning "class"
riots within the cities and visitors to the planet are advised to avoid 
wandering the streets without an official guide.

Shakhii is the outmost moon of the gas giant, Pesh. The world is covered by 
seas of dust. There is a single city/starport at Du' Saurier, and most of 
the population are independant miners. Status is gained through the 
granting of gifts to those poorer than yourself and great effort is made to 
find exotic gifts to grant so that the giver can increase their social 
position.

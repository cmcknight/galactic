Bwap colony specialising in crystal production. Most of the cities 
(pods) are built upon floating island of a coral-like substance and a 
symbiotic relationship has developed between the Bwap's and the island 
ecology. The Bwap's provide fertiliser for the many plants that 
intergrow in the coral and protection from the large ocean predators 
that like top eat the island soft coral underside. In return the 
ecology supplies food and protection for the inhabitants. Each city 
dweller rubs itself in the islands sap thereby identifying themselves 
to the various natural island defenses so they remain inert while they 
pass through. Although each Bwap community is generally classed as a 
"Religious Dictatorship" Arlu has been classified differently because 
each city or pod sends a chosen representative to a common council who 
then make all planetary decisions. In addition the planetary law level 
refers to the openly accessable areas of the planet and not the 
extremely high law levels of the pods which are off-limits to any but 
those born there.

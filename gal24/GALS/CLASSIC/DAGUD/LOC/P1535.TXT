Gas giant satellite, the planet is controlled by the Technocratic 
"Rulers of the Eye" who govern the city life support systems. The 
mining and city complexes are completely automated and the system is 
controlled by the Master Computer (MC). Status is determined by ability 
to successfully compete in the Robotic games in which contestants 
program warbots and try and defeat the MC's. Gaining a draw is rewarded 
by entry into the Ruling class who service the MC. To date, only one 
person has defeated the MC and he is regarded almost as a god by the 
population.

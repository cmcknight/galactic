Nafud was colonised by several families or clans early in the start of the 
Third Imperium. Nafudian society is migratory in that each "city" consists of 
thousands of surface vehicles fitted with life support. These "cities" move
around in order to find and extract minerals from the sand. The waste 
product, fine black sand is used throughout Ushra in electronic components 
and in water filtration systems. There is intense competition between clans 
and open warfare has been known to break out on a regular basis.

In 438 it was discovered that Nafud was home to a semi-intelligent species, 
the Inchok. Since then the Miidian Desert regions have been isolated while 
the IISS study the race.

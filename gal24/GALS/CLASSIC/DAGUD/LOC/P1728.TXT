A tidally locked world, most of the land surface is on the twilight and
darkside. The planet is mainly known for its computer programming systems and
financial skills. The planet specialises in setting up business and stock
control applications and customised government systems. The local university
is known for its excellent financial training and brokerage and as a result
graduates, known as Ekhui, with their distinctive three claw tattoo on the
forehead are in great demand.

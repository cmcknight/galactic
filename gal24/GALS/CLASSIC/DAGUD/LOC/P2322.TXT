A large asteroid which initially attracted colonisation as a result of its
mineral wealth. The cities are hollowed out of the rock and much of its
oxygen is mined from surrounding asteroids. The asteroid was obviously part
of a small planet which exploded millennia before and archaeologists believe
that it may have contained sentient life going by the few relics discovered
amongst the debris.

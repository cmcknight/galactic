Large, cool world noted both for the mysterious Joker's Tower and its small
chirper population. The chirpers, who were relocated to Nox from Elysium in
-276, have  equal rights  alongside their  human counterparts  and make up a
large proportion  of the governing council  despite numbering only 300
individuals in a single settlement.

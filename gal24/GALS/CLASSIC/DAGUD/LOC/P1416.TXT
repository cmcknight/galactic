Hellas was unpopulated until a survey by the Xenobiology unit
of  the University  of Ushra  in  677  identified Fillaslopu as  a
potential valuable food source. The  success of the pilot farms ensured
the  influx of  prospective farmers  who set  about trying  to tame the
frozen plains of  Hellas.

The main city on Hellas, Kendricks-Alaal, developed round an  atmospheric
terraforming  tower which  was  built to remove a sulphur taint from the
atmosphere. The Tower was later decommissioned  and  stripped  of the
terraforming machinery and refitted  as a residential area. It also  serves
as  an atmospheric  and environmental  monitoring station, taking  readings
from  the immediate  locale and  receiving data from a series of remote
sensing sateliites.

The Aslani make up a small but significant percentage of the total population
(about 2%) on Hellas for it is  estimated that this 2% hold approximatelly
22% of the total wealth.

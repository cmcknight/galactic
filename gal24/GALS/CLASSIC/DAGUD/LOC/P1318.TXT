Aberlocht is a frozen iceball of a planet with apparently no resources. An
orbital starport is maintained for refueling and repairs but the planet
itself is considered off-limits. Originally a base was established to allow
weapons testing on the surface but that was closed down in 756. The system is
still classed at a high technology level and, it is rumoured, The local
Ushran Navy has re-established a weapons research base on the surface. While
the Ushran Navy has confirmed that a small base has been established on the
surface they have denied that it is currently involved in weapons testing.

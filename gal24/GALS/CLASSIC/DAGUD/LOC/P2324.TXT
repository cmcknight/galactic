Originally established as a mining community, the Tilmen are known 
primarily for their xenophobic traditions. All visitors to the planet must 
keep their mouth covered when in the presence of Tilmen and must not speak. 
The Tilmen themselves are prohibited from speaking to off-worlders and all 
contact must take place only in writing. Those who fail to follow these 
laws will find themselves facing an obligatory month of ritual cleansing.

Tidally locked, half the world is a burning desert, the other half is 
locked in perpetual icy night. A narrow band known as Twilight 
provides ideal conditions for human habitation. Liishuga's satellite, 
Robmuir, is a size 2 in extremely close orbit and its presence results 
in shift in the zone back and forth in a regular pattern providing 
periods of light and dark. An extensive ecology exists within the zone 
and exotic variations in the less pleasant sunward and nightward zones. 
Most of the planet live in a massive twilight metropolis known as 
Heimdall. Expeditions to Sunward has revealed already smelted metals in 
surface pools. Exploitation of these metals are the source of the 
planet's wealth.

The planet has little to offer - very little mineral deposits, an 
extremely thin atmosphere. Its main advantage has been its "liberal" 
attitude towards criminals. Although a scout base was finally built 
in-system which put paid to Lushanuma's career as a pirate freeport it 
still has a reputation as a market for stolen goods. Its claimed that 
anything can be obtained - for a price.

The name  is taken from  an ancient Terran  novel 'Dr. Jekyll  and Mr.
Hyde', given by  the solomani who settled on this world.  It is a story
of a  doctor who uses drugs  to change his personality  to open up and
release his darker side. The analogy was drawn when the settlers first
experienced the wildly fluctuating climate.  At the equator the summer
temperature switches from 65oC to -11oC between day and night. At the
same  latitude the  temperature changes  between 65oC and  -64oC from
summer  to  winter.  There  are  more  extreme  fluctuations at higher
latitudes. This has  kept colonisation to a minimum,  but the world is
well  served  with  a  class  A  starport  as  Jekyll  is an important
transport nexus within the subsector.

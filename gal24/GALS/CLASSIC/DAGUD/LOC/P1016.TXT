Ushra is the only tech level-16 Industrial world in Dagudashaag sector, and 
so occupies an important position in the sector's economy. Interestingly, the 
democratic nature of Ushra's government, has meant that TL16 technology has 
reached the general population far sooner than might otherwise be expected 
(the highest levels of technology are often monopolised by the military in 
many systems). The standard of living enjoyed by the population is second to 
none.

Eden Orbital Naval Complex is a large facility devoted to shipbuilding and 
repair of naval vessels. A great deal of development work is done at the 
complex, directed towards the production of prototype TL-16 naval vessels. 
Several successful designs have been produced so far, the largest of these 
being the 40,000-ton strike cruiser Alexander Brayden.

Other research work is carried out at Naval installations elsewhere in the 
system. Reports that the Navy has established an antimatter production and 
containment facility insystem have been consistently denied.

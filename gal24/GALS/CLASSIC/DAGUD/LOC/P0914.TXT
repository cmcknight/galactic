The whole population of the Undim Belt reside in the settlement of Olosquis 
and work for UMT which houses its major research base here. The settlement 
both tests new equipment and mines the belt for its many unusual elements.

Whilst UMT is the only employer the Government is run seperately though the 
views of UMT do carry a great deal of weight.

REFEREES ONLY:

Undim was originally the homeworld of the Malaach which were destroyed by the 
Ancients. The planet was destroyed by a huge salvo of crust busters which led 
to planetary core instability. The planet destroyed itself in the process. 
The richness of the belt is a direct result of this. Because the system is so 
lightly populated no discovery has yet been made of the many Malaach 
artifacts that exist.

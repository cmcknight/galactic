Originally established by Vilani zealots fleeing religious persecution, 
the colonists were obviously influenced by alien artifacts found on the 
planet during the period of the Long Night. By the time they were re-
contacted they had evolved into a strong dictatorship whereby the ruler 
is a mysterious character chosen by the people at maturity and then 
cloistered within the Pearl Tower at Tralarwl. The monarch never 
appears in public again nor does he leave the tower. Audiences are 
granted from behind a screen of translucent pearl behind which can be 
seen the rulers outline. Even his voice is only heard by the First 
Prelate who repeats his words for all to hear. The system was apparently 
established to allow decisions to be made on an objective basis and 
protects the ruler from both foes and would-be favourites. The cities 
are famous for being made of large granite blocks cut exactly to shape 
so that not even a needle can be inserted between the uncemented 
blocks. Gaesh exports Greum beef throughout the sector as well as the 
grain used to make Argian Bhair.

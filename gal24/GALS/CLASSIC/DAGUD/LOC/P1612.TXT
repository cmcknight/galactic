This  world has  been settled  since the  first vilani explorations of
Dagudashaag. Although outwardly idyllic  Lemuria has resisted attempts
at extensive colonisation due to large number of differing microscopic
pathogens  which have  an alarming  predaliction for  the vilani.  The
world  on  a  number  of  occasions  has  been quarantined with access
strictly controlled. There have been six colonisation expeditions, the
most recent in  642, and all have met the  same fate - extinction. The
most common  causes of death are  respiratory and circulatory distress
although the further  removed from the vilani race  the more resistant
individuals  are  against  these   diseases.  The  current  population
comprises IISS  scientists and technicians from  the service's medical
branch investigating  the problem. It  is believed that  the IISS have
now developed a  range of vaccines to allow  future, safe colonisation
efforts.


The Argi subsector (N) is an important industrial centre, and
communications link - the Dagudashaag Main covers the trailward
half of the region, and the waystation at Lenashuuk/Argi handles
a great deal of traffic between Dagudashaag and Zarushagar. All
of the more highly-populated systems in the trailward region were
settled during the rule of the First Imperium. The Dagudashaag
Main, having been heavily settled for such a long time, is a
technologically-advanced region - most of the systems between
Gateway/Argi and Durgaruur/Sapphyre are at or above TL13. The
coreward tip of the Nimluin cluster, part of which falls in Argi
subsector, is a rich agricultural region.

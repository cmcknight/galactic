Despite its population, Iinir is styled a modern "Garden of Eden". Its cities
are all built under the oceans and the land is left totally undeveloped. Its
wildlife are completely allergic to human blood and they have learnt to avoid
attacking human's or other two legged creatures as a result. Tourists can
walk to within metres of a sparring pair of Hxieh (20 metre long carnivores)
in total safety. The planet also has no insect life to trouble the visitor.

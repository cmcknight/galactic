The Kamgik's are an extremely conservative and unaggressive race that seems 
to revere all life. It comes as a shock to visitors that the Kamgik's are 
actually cannibalistic. At the funeral services, which can often go on for 
days, they eat the cooked body of their dead relations even down to 
grinding down the bones and mixing it with meal so that no part of the body 
is "rejected". Even visitors to a feast are expected to partake of some of 
the less favoured parts. Only once a youth has eaten of the "Flesh" may 
they be named. They take on the name of the person they just consumed. This 
can cause confusion as the custom makes no distinction based on sex and as 
a result many female Kamgik's have male names and vice-versa.

Cocor would be a near-deserted world were it not for the mysterious
stone-built roads that traverse the planet. Tourists flock to the planet each
year to examine the many kilometres of roads and to guess as to their origin.
The only permanent site on-planet is the research base set up by the
University of Medurma to research the roads and the independent mining sites.

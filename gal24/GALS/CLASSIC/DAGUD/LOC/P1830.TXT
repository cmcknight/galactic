Settled about -1050 by Aslan migrants from Gushemege Sector. The colony was
too small to form a viable technological base and Clan Home regressed to
pre-industrial levels during the latter part of the Long Night. Aslan
cultural prejudice turned to xenophobia and the world voluntarily isolated
itself from the interstellar community in the first years of the Third
Imperium.

As of 1100, however, Clan Home has begun a tentative re-emergence and is
slowly industrialising, with all its associated problems. Travellers to the
planet should be aware that IISS technology import restrictions are in force,
to shield the natives from 'culture shock'.

Much of this world is extremely cold. This has made gathering of the Agadua
crop extremely difficult. Most are gathered using romotely pilotted vehicles
or (occationally) by robots.

Antioch is also a rich source of raw materials for several Ushran industries
and corporations who are the main employers on the planet. The mining is done
within environmentally controlled domes.

During the First Imperium an artists enclave was established here. Although
wiped out during the Long Night, the tradition has continued and Antioch ice
sculptures are exhibited as far away as Terra.

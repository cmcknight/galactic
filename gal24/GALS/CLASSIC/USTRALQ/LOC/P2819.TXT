 Erice  2819 (H0409) UWP: C3437AB-6 M  Po
              
      Erice and Umak (2920 D345766-2) form the League of Erice. The King, 
Imast Hiyu the fourth, has implemented many restrictions on technology imported
to both worlds to keep his citizens from realizing their lives could be better.




*** Referee's Note ****



      The King, Imast Hiyu the fourth, is a clone of the original Imast Hiyu. 
The first King didn't believe that a better King than himself could be born, so
he decided his clones would be the new Kings for Erice. The clones are 
represented as the sons of the previous King to the populance.

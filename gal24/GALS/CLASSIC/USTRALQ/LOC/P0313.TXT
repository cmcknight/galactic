      This world is controlled by the Aslan Tlaunkhu bloc Syoisuis. They have 
restricted the starport from being used by any other clan than their own.
Consider the starport to be class D for Syoisuis clan. This restriction has 
started many rumors about what kind of crops are grown here,what they are used
for, and where they are exported to. Another rumor suggests there may an 
assassin training ground here.

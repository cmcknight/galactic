       Three expeditions from the Solomani Confederation and nine more from
the Aslan Hierate have disappeared while exploring this world. Orbital surveys
and atmospheric probes haven't revealed any sign of dangerous elements in the 
air or detection of any sign of intelligent life. Probes and ships that land
disappear within 4-5 days of landing. The crew and personal of these ships 
vanish within 1 hour of landing. Life signs sent back to orbiting ships end at
the same time.

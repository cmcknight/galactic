 Izir   2917 (H0507)  UWP: D989567-6     Ni O:(2915)

        Izir is a stormy, dense-aired, oceanic world in orbit of a star which
gives off frequent solar flares. These flares prevented the colonists from 
using radio commucations. GenAssist decided to geneer the colonists giving 
them speech and hearing that extends into the subsonic range. This allows the 
colonists to commuicate over the many kilometers of the great Ardun Archipelago.
        Iziri (as the colonists are called) have a bullet-shaped head with 
long ears that reach from near the top of their heads down to the bottom of the
neck. Large vocal cords extend from the sides of the neck to front bottom of 
the neck. The big ears have caused some to call the Iziri 'Dimbos' after an
ancient Terran children's video program.

     Owned by the Tlaukhu bloc clan Seieakh, this world is the site of a 
minor archaeological dig of a dead civilization. The finds consist of mostly
bronze objects, which have become very popular on nearby worlds. The company 
of Hera'oh controls most of the artifact trade, but has been known to allow 
others to pick up cargos infequently.

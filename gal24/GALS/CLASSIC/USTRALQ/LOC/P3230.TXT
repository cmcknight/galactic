     The Yaren government was recently overthrown by Aslan Ihatei from the 
nearby Imperial client state of Oleaiy'fte. The Ihatei settled on any unused 
land and forced the landholder council to recognize their claims, vote to join
the Oleaiy'fte state, and then disbanded the council. The remaining landholders 
in hiding are hiring mercenary companies to help in their revolt.

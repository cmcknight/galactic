      The amber zone on Aachen was created to prevent members of the minor race
A'ach'en from leaving the surface. A'ach'en are flying insects around 8-10 
centimeters long. When joined with about 80-100 others, they create a hive
mind with average Solomani intelligence. When they were first discovered, it 
was decided that Aachen would be governed as a Protectorate under the control 
of SolSec.

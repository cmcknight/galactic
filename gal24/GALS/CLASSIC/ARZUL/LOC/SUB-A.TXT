Rrazz Subsector
---------------

Unlike most of the rest of the Julian Protectorate, this area has a 
relatively low Human population, and the Vargr population here and in 
Khikku subsector, to trailing, is primarily Suedzuk Vargr.  None of the 
planets in this region of the Protectorate are members of regional 
polities, and isolationist views prevail here.  For the most part, the 
Vargr here have indicated a desire to break with the reputation of the 
Suedzuk and participate in interstellar society on an equal basis, but 
acceptance has been slow in coming.

Vanguard Reaches - Credits
--------------------------

The Vanguard Reaches data are reproduced here with permission
of the author, Chuck Kallenbach II <scoundrl@inlink.com>.  Chuck 
expressed the wish that we use the data provided on the Paranoia
Press homepage rather than what was in the actual sector book
(copyright 1981).  These new data, Chuck feels, cover both MT
and TNE and should be valid for T4 as well.

The text for the Library Data was provided by Chuck at his
web site and structured and adapted, without modification to
the wording, for use in GALACTIC.

The stories entitled Von Ryan's War and the Loser's Perspective
were provided by Chuck at the same site and incorporated into
the information for the Duchy of Trelyn.  Von Ryan's War is
reproduced by permission of the author, Chuck Kallenbach II.
The Loser's Perspective is credited to Dan Hillen from original 
ideas by Don Rapp.  Proper credits can be found at the Paranoia 
Press homepage.

Michel Boucher <alsandor@lords.com> organized the information
for use in GALACTIC.

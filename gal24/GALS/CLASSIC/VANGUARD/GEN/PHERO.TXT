Pheromone: A chemical substance that is produced by
an animal and serves as a specific stimulus to other
individuals of the same species for one or more behavioral
responses. The role of the Eslyat pheromone communication
system in their sociological development is not completely
understood. An Eslyat can send at least base, simple emotions
by the emission of chemicals to be received by another
Eslyat. The degree and frequency of this communication is
unknown. These chemicals are colloquially called "smells,"
but they are undetectable with human olfactory systems. Only
high-technology chemical "sniffers" can find and categorize
the pheromones.

The broad, "slapstick" quality of Eslyat broadcast
entertainment derives from the difficulty of communicating
subtle shades of emotion over most media. As a result, Eslyat
dramas and tridee shows exhibit considerable "overacting,"
once considered to be indicative of their primitive
lifestyles. Research has shown that Eslyat appreciation of
the fine arts is actually very refined, and their literature
and visual arts are of high quality.

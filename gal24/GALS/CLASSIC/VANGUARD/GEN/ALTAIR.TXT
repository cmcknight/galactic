Altarean Confederation: The government of the Murian
minor race in Subsector N of the Vanguard Reaches. The
Murians have extensively explored and consolidated this
subsector, founding a long-lasting, advanced and well-
developed society spanning some 28 systems.

Although the Confederation government appears stable,
the politics of the individual worlds are somewhat chaotic.
Murians have a naturally combative nature among themselves.
Combine this with their tendency toward individualism and the
result is political systems which are highly participatory
with frequent government changes. Non-popular dictatorships
and self-perpetuating oligarchies are almost non-existent.
Democracies are the most stable governments. At times,
however, the most popular form is government by riot.

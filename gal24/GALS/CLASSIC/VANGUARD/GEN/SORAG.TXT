SORAG: SORAG (pronounced "SOAR-ag") is a special
purpose, non-military division of the Zhodani Consulate
Combined Interstellar Forces. The name is an acronym for
Study and Operations Recording Activities Group. The purpose
of SORAG is to observe the progress of emerging interstellar
societies using passive means by receiving civilian
transmissions of various types and recording or cataloging
the facts therein. SORAG is a means whereby the Zhodani can
stay abreast of changes in the government and technological
levels of various societies within the Consulate and its
Client States. Although employees are paid via a pay scale
similar to most military systems, SORAG is not directly
affiliated with any military organization.

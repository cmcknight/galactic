Murians: The Altarean Confederation is a political and
cultural entity populated by a minor race who refer to
themselves as Murians.

Murians are an ursoid race that tends to be larger and
stronger than humans. However, they exhibit poorer manual
dexterity. The average Murian male is 2 meters tall and
weighs 105 kilograms. Though they are hairier than humans,
they do not begin to match the coat of the Vargr.

As individuals, they are open, friendly, and curious
with other races. They are somewhat clannish and are
seldom found outside their Confederation. Although their size
and great patience can give the appearance of slow-
wittedness, they are well-educated and very mechanically
inclined. They are talented at the building and use of
computers.

As a race, the Murians are non-aggressive. They have
shared a peaceful border with a Zhodani client for many
decades. The few real wars they have fought have been
defensive in nature. Although their armed forces are
efficient and well-armed, their primary job appears to be
commerce protection. Their over-reliance on missiles as a
space combat weapon places them at a tactical disadvantage.
The Confederation poses no threat to Imperial security for
the foreseeable future.

Murian technology is of a high order. Technology is more
evenly distributed throughout the Confederation than is
typical in the Imperium. The most backward Altarean colony
has a tech level rating of A. The Confederation Capitol,
Arcturus, in the Altair system, has a tech level rating of D.

Five worlds in the Altarean Confederation are identified
as Murian "home worlds." The reason for this identification
and the location of the true Murian home world is unknown.

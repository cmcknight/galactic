Regional Commerce & Growth Association (RCGA): A loose
group of corporations banded together to expand commerce in
the Serpent Trace, a cluster of systems located in the
astrographic center of the Vanguard Reaches sector. Largely a
mail union, the RCGA has a few police troops and patrol ships
but fields no interstellar navy. Their symbol is an expanding
tree of growth.

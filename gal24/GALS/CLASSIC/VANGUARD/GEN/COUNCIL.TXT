Council of Worlds: A conference held on Telleria
(Vanguard Reaches 0926 A-877944-A) in 1089 with members of
all worlds of the Tellerian Cluster except Necto and Zelos.
Altarean Confederation representatives, Driantia Steblenzhtia
delegates, Aslan emissaries and diplomats from the Duchy of
Trelyn were present. The basic thrust of the council was a
non-interference agreement with regard to inner struggles of
the Tellerian Cluster. These Wars of Colonization are still
continuing within the area, although its neighbors have so
far respected the Council decisions. Free passage along the
Jump-2 route from the Altarean Confederation to the Driantia
Steblenzhtia was guaranteed by the Council, although this
route passes through two systems of the Tellerian Cluster.

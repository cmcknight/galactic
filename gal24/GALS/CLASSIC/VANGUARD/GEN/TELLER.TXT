Tellerian Cluster: A group of six systems of roughly the
same technological level (interstellar community level) who
are on basically good trade terms with the Altarean
Confederation. However, there continues in the cluster a
lengthy series of wars and infighting concerning unoccupied
worlds in several systems. Export or import of weapons
between other interstellar communities and the Tellerian
Cluster is strictly illegal. Efforts are made to disinclude
travellers from the constant warfare, but the area remains
dangerous.

VANREX: An acronym for Vanguard Reaches Extra, VANREX is
a sector-wide news service run by an independent corporation
based on the world Trommler (1618 C-5109B9-B). Correspondents
travel from this central location to wherever news happens
throughout the Vanguard Reaches. Reports from the Far
Frontiers and Malikhar Crescent sectors are routinely filed
as well.

As a well-respected source of accurate, timely and non-
biased information, VANREX bureaus can be found in virtually
every A-class starport in the Reaches. Operating with high-
tech holovideo recording equipment, VANREX has its own fleet
of courier starships (made up mostly of surplus Type S scouts
from the Duchy of Trelyn).

VANREX's list of accomplishments include the exoneration
of Grand Duchess Lyssa Dyana of the Duchy of Trelyn during
her anagathics scandal. A hard-hitting documentary about
treaty violations by Aslan diplomats in the Tellerian Cluster
was credited with averting a war with the Altarean
Confederation.

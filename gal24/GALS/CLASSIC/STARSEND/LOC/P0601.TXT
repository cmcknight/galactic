This system should be considered to be an Ancient artifact in its 
entirety.  Other than the mainworld belt and the one gas giant, the 
only other body in the system is an artificial satellite of size 5 in 
orbit around the gas giant.  Attempts to come within 15AU of the 
primary of the system results in the destruction of the vessel in 
question, through an agency that is unknown.  The best defenses 
available to investigating ships have been insufficient to protect 
them.

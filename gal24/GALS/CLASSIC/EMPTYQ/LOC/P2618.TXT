Ruins is aptly named - although uninhabited today, there are ruins of a
human or near-human civilization over the entire planet; it appears that
they had achieved TL8 before destroying themselves in a nuclear war.  The
same nuclear war appears to be responsible for the near-total absence of
planetary atmosphere; indications are that the atmosphere would have been
classified as either thin or thin-tainted.

While the Hegemony of Lorean explicitly does not claim this world in its
domain, Lorean ships mount a "memorial patrol" of the system, with the aim
of preventing anyone from disturbing the ruins.


Empty Quarter - Credits
-----------------------

The Empty Quarter UWP data along with a few of the world names were
initially created by Digest Group Publications. Joe Fugate posted this
data to GEnie in 1989. The Newts are from Aliens Archive and JTAS
issues 3 & 11. Alvin Plummer (alvin.plummer@sheridanc.on.ca) developed
the sector further in 1996, naming the rest of the worlds and adding
the jump routes. Jeff Zeitlin (jeff.zeitlin@execnet.com) converted the
sector to Galactic format in 1997, adding some planetary comments as
well as the Beta Niobe Nebula.


Gateway Sector - Credits
------------------------

The Gateway Sector was originally published by Digest Group
Publications in _The Megatraveller Journal_, #4. It was
apparently for Willian H. Keith's Lords of Thunder Campaign
(circa 1120-1123). The sector was designed by Thomas A. Dundee.

Jens Maskus (Jens.Maskus@stud.uni-hannover.de) converted the
sector to Galactic format in 1997.

It is interesting to note that this region of space was done
twice before. In 1981, Judges Guild published Dave Sering's
Maranantha-Alkahest Sector, at the time an approved Traveller
product, though it was declared invalid by GDW in 1984. It is
in this publication that we see first mention of the "Gateway
Quadrant" which seems to be intended to refer to the entire area
of space covered by the four Judges Guild sectors. Also, in the
Aug/Sept 1982 issue of _Pegasus_, Judges Guild published Edward
Kuns' Tagret Sector (whether they realized they were revising an
area of space that they themselves already already covered
remains a mystery).

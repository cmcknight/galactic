# Notes:
# There was a "+" Tech level given as Occasional non-Imperial, but as there
# already was a "G" in the The Traveller Book (which is what I'm using), I
# decided to remove it. Maybe it wasn't in the original set of three booklets.
# "V" may appear under any UWP characteristic, indicating that it varies,
# either naturally or artificially, from point to point or from time to
# time. This should of course call for the GM to explain this phenomenon,
# if indeed it is one. The reasons could be as varied as accelerated
# development to civil war or simply a factor of the environment or
# civilisation, not unlike what happens on Helliconia in Aldiss' books.

[It must be noted that the information in BEYOND is from the
first edition and that there is an update which has not been
included here.  Chuck Kallenbach explains the differences
by stating that the original survey was not done accurately and
there were many irregularities which explains the presence of
many strange objects, such as the ringworld at 2819.  The more
updated version will be posted soon]

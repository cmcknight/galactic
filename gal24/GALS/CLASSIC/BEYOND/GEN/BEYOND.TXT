INTRODUCTION

"Beyond the Great Rift, beyond the Imperium and beyond the law" adequately
describes both the location and the climate of those sixteen subsectors
which comprise the sector known, simply, as Beyond.
    Beyond lies directly coreward of the Great Rift, rimward of the Zhodani
Consulate, and some 120 parsecs due spinward of Capital, itself.  The
trailing coreward portion of Beyond is considered by some astrographers to
be part of the Out Rim Void, a relatively uncharted area concentrated in the
spinward part of the adjacent trailing sector.
    Located immediately spinward-rimward of the Spinward Marches, Beyond
shares with it a reputation for conflict and intrigue.  It is here in
Beyond that the traveller will find the strongest concentration of
Comsentient Alliance worlds and protectorates--as well as Aslan, Droyne,
Mal'Gnar, Eslyat and Sred*Ni settlements.  Some of the latter are
full-fledged members of the Alliance; some seek admission to, or at least
association with, the Imperium; and some, such as the Mal'Gnar, remain
aloof to the petty maneuverings og Humaniti and other sentients" and wish
only to be left undisturbed.
    Beyond consists of sixteen subsectors with a total of 463 worlds.
The total population as of 335-1042 was 561 billion sentients, distributed
as follows: 493.7 billion Humaniti (including less than 10 thousand Zhodani
and 35.5 billion Mal'Gnar); 37.8 billion Aslan; 29.5 billion Sred*Ni; and
967 thousand Droyne.

    This is a compendium of data about Beyond.  It provides pregenerated
subsectors for use by TRAVELLER referees and players, as well as a source
of library data concerning the locations and installations for use in any
TRAVELLER campaign or scenarios.

REQUIRED MATERIAL

    In addition to these data, GDW's basic TRAVELLER, THE SPINWARD MARCHES,
and TWILIGHT'S PEAK, and Paranoia Press' VANGUARD REACHES are necessary
for complete understanding of many of the terms and symbols used herein.

STANDARDS AND ASSUMPTIONS

    As in TRAVELLER SUPPLEMENT 3, THE SPINWARD MARCHES, the following
assumptions are used in the text of this booklet.  They may be altered as
necessary to correspond to the situations in which the travellers may
find themselves.

DATES: All dates herein conform to the Imperial Calendar, although the
major cohesive political entity in Beyond is the Comsentient Alliance.  The
assumed date for these data is 052-1107, the 52nd day of the 1107th year
of the Imperium and, parenthetically, the 403rd year of the Comsentient
Alliance.

PLANETARY DATA: The Universal Planetary Profile as described in the
TRAVELLER BOOK 3, WORLDS AND ADVENTURES, is utilized throughout to describe
the characteristics of the worlds within Beyond.  Trade Classifications
under TRADE NDX conform to those described in THE SPINWARD MARCHES.
Additional notes which may be of interest to travellers are also included
under each Subsector info.  The Travellers' Aid Society Travel Zone
Classifications have been widely adopted in Beyond and TAS hostels may be
founbd at most Class A and many Class B starports.  The codes are: "A"
for an Amber Zone; "R" for a Red Zone; and "G" for a gas giant.
    The following additional characteristics have been added to those
described in TRAVELLER, BOOK 3, WORLDS AND ADVENTURES, in order to reflect
the unique nature of Beyond.

                        or artificially, from point to point or from time
                        to time.

SPECIAL INSTALLATIONS AND WORLD ALIGNMENTS

Because there are many political factions within Beyond, an expanded system
of codes has been developed to aid the traveller in identifying the various
installations and political alignments.  The following special installations
may be found under each Subsector info.

ARCHIVES: A repository of public, official, military, and/or historical
records.  It is usually associated with one or more of the political
factions within Beyond, although there is rumored to be at least one
Imperial archive in die Weltbund.

ASSASSINS' INSTITUTE: An installation dedicated to the education and
training of assassins.  The institute may consist of one or more buildings,
one or more villages or undeveloped areas, or even the entire world.

CONTAINMENT FACILITY: The entire world has been developed and is being
maintained as a containment facility (prison) for those adjudged guilty
of crimes against prevailing laws, customs, and/or mores.  In the case
of the Comsentient Alliance, the only crime which carries a penalty of
"containment" is that of deliberate anti-sentient activities.  Normally,
containment facilities will carry a Red Zone classification, but in any
case visits are absolutely forbidden unless authorized (or one way).

OUTPOST: An outpost is similar to an Imperial way station but is, of
course, non-Imperial.  The base has been established for the storage,
maintenance, refitting, and refuelling of equipment belonging to the
political faction which has final authority over the outpost or subsector.

RELAY POINT: A location committed to the relaying of data, goods or
entities for specific purposes.  Many of these are Licensed
Information/Communication Exchange (LICE) relay points; some of these are
Imperial way stations leased from, or at least tolerated by, the
Comsentient Alliance.

RESEARCH FACILITY: A facility dedicated to one or more research projects
of particular interest to one or more political factions or private
corporations.

SANCTUARY: A world where any sentient may find safety, regardless of its
reason for seeking sanctuary.  While extradition is almost impossible,
especially without the consent of the individual, the sanctuary given may
be less desirable than the expected punishment.  Often, a sentient given
sanctuary has few of the rights of the indigenous population--this could
include carrying or owning weapons, the right to vote, the right to
appeal a decision, and the opportunity to earn a living.

IMPERIAL INSTALLATIONS: There are cases of Imperial installations within
Beyond.  The most noteworthy of these is Starbase Arcturus II/I-Glathriel.
Its stated purpose is the observation of the stellar fluctuation of
Delta Cephei in the Spinward Drift, but the Comsentient Alliance is well
aware of its true purpose--observe the Aslan and the Comsentient Alliance,
and any other cohesive political force in Beyond, and maintain xboat
communications with Capital.

CHRONOLOGY OF BEYOND

To students of history, the year is 6380 A.U.C.  To Terrans, it is 5628 A.D.
Within the Comsentient Alliance, it is 402 F.S.  But by Imperial reckoning,
the year is 1107.  Within Beyond, three of these dating systems are widely
utilized: Imperium, Terran and Alliance (dated from the first sitting of
the Grand Council at Rabanitas/Zydar).  This chronology covers the basic
historical events of Beyond, showing the date of the event in each of the
three systems.

Ok, here goes:

Starport	V	Variable

Diameter	A	10,000 miles or 16,093 kilometers
		B	12,000 miles or 19,312 kilometers
		C	13,000 miles or 20,921 kilometers
		J	Ringworld
		V	Variable		

Atmosphere	D	Carbon dioxide
		M	Methane
		R	Radioactive
		V	Variable

Hydrographics	V	Variable

Population	V	Variable

Government	E	Patriarchal warrior elite
		F	Select military elite
		V	Variable	

Law Level	A	May not own energy weapons
		B	May not own military weapons
		C	May not own concealable firearms
		D	May not own any type of firearms
		E	May not own bladed weapons
		F	May not own anything which may be used as a weapon
		V	Variable

Tech Level 	V	Variable

Notes:

There was a + Tech level given as Occasional non-Imperial, but as there
already was a G in the The Traveller Book (which is what I'm using), I decided
to remove it.

Maybe it wasn't in the original set of three booklets.

V = May appear under any UWP characteristic, indicating that it varies,
either naturally or artificially, from point to point or from time to
time.  This should of course call for the GM to explain this phenomenon,
if indeed it is one.  The reasons could be as varied as accelerated
development to civil war or simply a factor of the environment or
civilisation, not unlike what happens on Helliconia in Aldiss' books.

Maybe other people have more codes they'd like to add ;-)

The Northeast Middle Beyond was named due to its relative position (and
the Terran-oriented sense of humour of the scout in charge) from the
arbitrary survey point established by the IISS in 93.  This arbitrary
point may better be defined as the meeting place of four subsectors:
Metchi'Alagwa, Northeast Middle Beyond, Middle Beyond, and the I'Sred*Ni
Heptad.

The forays of the Comsentient Alliance, the Mal'Gnar and the Sred*Ni into
the Northeast Middle Beyond frequently erupt into minor firefights which
tend to break the existing detente.  Travellers are warned to proceed with
caution and to not leave the established jump routes.  It is also advisable
for travellers to remain within the confines of starports when planetside
and not to seek to explore the surrounding areas.

Silbe is both homeworld and base of operations of Merchant Master Keith Ford
and ex-Force Commander Roger "Sam" Craddock.

Ford owns and operates an 800-ton Delta Research Type MN Merchant, "The
Duchess of Kent," which is definitely for hire to whomever has the credits.
IDES's reports indicate "The Duchess" has been retrofitted as a mercenary
transport.

Craddock is the commanding officer of one of the best trained and equipped
mercenary legions in Beyond, "Roger's Rangers."  Craddock's Mercenary Legion
has achieved marked successes in the service of the Northeast Middle Beyond
subsector government against Sred*Ni Planetary Neutralization Forces.

IDES Marchers on Silbe report having seen Ford and Craddock in frequent
contact.  Extrapolation of known data leads IDES to forecast a mercenary
expedition to Caledonia involving the Ford-Craddock team.  A Sred*Ni PNF
has already established a small outpost on Caledonia, numbering fewer than
a thousand Sred*Ni warriors.

The Northeast Middle Beyond has 11.53 billion sentient inhabitants on 20
worlds.  Its highest tech level is E at Revelation, and its highest
population is A at Steimetz.

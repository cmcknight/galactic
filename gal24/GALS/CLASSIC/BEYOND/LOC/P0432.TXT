System: Delta Cephei Base

Imperial observatory.

Imperial Installations: There are cases of Imperial installations within
Beyond.  The most noteworthy of these is Starbase Arcturus II/I-Glathriel.
Its stated purpose is the observation of the stellar fluctuations of Delta
Cephei in the Spinward Drift, but the Comsentient Alliance is well aware
of its true purpose--observe the Aslan and the Comsentient Alliance, and any
other cohesive political force in Beyond, and maintain xboat communications
with Capital.  (from BEYOND, Paranoia Press, 1981, p. 3).

Situated outside the recognized boundaries of the Comsentient Alliance, and
extending coreward into the Harem and Piah Subsectors and spinward into the
Liberty Hall Subsector, die Weltbund is a loose confederation of many worlds
which lends its name to this subsector.  The capital of die Weltbund itself
is Bundestag and its subcapital is Oberpr„sidenten; the latter also serves
as the capital of the subsector.

The first explorers and settlers of this subsector at first imagined (and
finally convinced) themselves that they were the lineal descendants of the
early developers of Terra's space programs.  This is evidenced by a marked
tendency to cast the world names in Germanic forms.  Strangely enough, in
spite of their beliefs, their worlds remain largely non-industrial.

Recent surveys indicate extensive large minerals deposits on Liebeslied.
The most predominant metals appear to be copper, silver, lead, gold and
uranium.

Die Weltbund has 1.23 billion sentient inhabitants of 30 worlds.  Its
highest tech level is E at Bundestag, and its highest population is 9 at
Zaroq Nova IX.

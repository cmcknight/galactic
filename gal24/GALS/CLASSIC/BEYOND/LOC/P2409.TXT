System: Shequonur

This system is a Sanctuary.

Sanctuary worlds are worlds where any sentient may find safety, regardless
of its reason for seeking sanctuary.  While extradition is almost impossible,
especially without the consent of the individual, the sanctuary given may be
less desirable than the expected punishment.  Often, a sentient given
sanctuary has few of the rights of the indigenous population--this could
include carrying or owning weapons, the right to vote, the right to appeal a
decision, and the opportunity to earn a living.  (from BEYOND, Paranoia
Press, 1981, p. 3).

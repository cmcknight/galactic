The Mal'Gnar Radiant lies at the Spinward-Rimward extreme of the famed
Spinward Marches and contains the only commercial jump route from the
Marches--from Raweh/Five Sisters (0109-B130300-B-N) via Methuselah/Piah
(0810-A874228-A-2) to Vrel D'Vargr in the Radiant.

There are numerous legends told of the Mal'Gnar Radiant.  The most persistent
of these concerns the deliberate seeding of the Radiant by the Ancients.
Just recently, research xenogeneticists studying the Mal'Gnar at Mal'Gnar,
the subsector capital, have discovered that their DNA chain had, indeed,
been subtly manipulated by artificial means.  The Mal'Gnar themselves
actively supported the research, obviously hoping to prove their descendancy
from the Ancients, whether through natural evolution or not.

But it is just this tenuous connection with the Ancients which reinforces
Mal'Gnar desire for solitude.  Travellers are not encouraged within the
Radiant proper, and harsh penalties may be imposed upon trespassers.

There are Ancients' ruins and museums at Castillo la Vieja and Castillo la
Nueva.

Almost one-third of the Radiant worlds are agricultural.

The Mal'Gnar Radiant has 1.18 billion sentient inhabitants on 32 worlds.
Its highest tech level is + at Mal'Gnar/Krusk, and its highest population
is 9 at Mal'Drur.

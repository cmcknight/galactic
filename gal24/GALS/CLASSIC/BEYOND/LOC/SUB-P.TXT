The Aslani Subsector represents the spinward extents of the Aslan Colonial
States, although the States do extend into the Storm Subsector.  The Aslan
maintain a peaceful coexistence with other members of the Comsentient
Alliance, but there is a marked distrust of the Sred*Ni--especially in view
of the apparent thrust being made to extend the I'Sred*Ni Heptad influence
into the Aslani Subsector.  While there have been several small skirmishes,
usually involving vessels of less than 1,000 tons, any large-scale
engagements have been kept to an absolute minimum.  It has been rumoured
that the Aslan are hiring large numbers of ship-owning mercenaries to
protect their coreward and spinward borders.  First Admiral, the Lady Lysilph
Kunseba has dispatched a Comsentient Alliance task force to investigate, led
by the battle-cruiser _Teopahconli_Nebi_.

It is also rumoured that there are Ancients' ruins, including museums, deep
within the heart of the subsector.  It is known that there is a minor Droyne
settlement on the Aslan world of 0.5 Phast.  It is also known that the
Imperium is maintaining a research facility, under Aslan tolerance, at Hoelle
VII.

The Aslani Subsector has 13.35 billion sentient inhabitants on 27 worlds.
Its highest tech level is C at Boeing, and its highest population is A at
Garfield Station.

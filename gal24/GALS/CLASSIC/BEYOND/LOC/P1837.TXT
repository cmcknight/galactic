System: Stormhaven

This system is a relay point.

A Relay Point is a location committed to the relaying of data, goods, or
entities for specific purposes.  Many of these are Licensed Information/
Communication Exchange (LICE) relay points; some of these are Imperial
way stations leased from, or at least tolerated by, the Comsentient Alliance.

"Come in, gentlemen.  This is Liberty Hall: you can spit on the mat and call
the cat a bastard." So went the old Terran saying of the 18th century
(approximately 1876 PI).  And it is exactly so in the Liberty Hall Subsector.
Most of the inhabited worlds have very low tech and law levels, which makes
each stop an adventure.  Liberty Hall was being settled during that period
of time known to Imperial historians as "9 p.m.".  It continues to reflect
the prevalent attitudes of that early time.

Liberty Hall is largely non-industrial.  Lanthanum and dialminium deposits
have been reported on Hardass and mining operations are scheduled to begin
as soon as the Comsentient Alliance can settle the question as to whose
claim was registered first -- Amalgamated Minerals and Mining, of
Intercourse/Delta; or Amax Processors Limited, of Battelle/Zydar.

Oxygen and water have been reported in the deepest valleys of Abyss and
animals, insects, and vegetation are present.  The prospect of humanoid
settlement is being investigated.

Liberty Hall subsector has 10.13 billion sentient inhabitants on 29 worlds.
Its highest tech level is D at Liberty Hall and Drei Farben and its highest
population is A at Kalturia.

System: Refuge

This system houses archives and is a sanctuary.

Archives are a repository of public, official, military, and/or historical
records.  It is usually associated with one or more of the political factions
within Beyond, although there is rumoured to be at least one Imperial archive
in die Weltbund.  (from BEYOND, Paranoia Press, 1981, p. 2).

Sanctuary worlds are worlds where any sentient may find safety, regardless
of its reason for seeking sanctuary.  While extradition is almost impossible,
especially without the consent of the individual, the sanctuary given may be
less desirable than the expected punishment.  Often, a sentient given
sanctuary has few of the rights of the indigenous population--this could
include carrying or owning weapons, the right to vote, the right to appeal a
decision, and the opportunity to earn a living.  (from BEYOND, Paranoia
Press, 1981, p. 3).

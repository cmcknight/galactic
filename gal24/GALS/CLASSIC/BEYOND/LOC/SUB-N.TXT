I-Glathriel has been a training ground for the merchant service and the scout
service since it was first charted.  It has often been said that more
finely-honed officers are forged from base metal here, than anywhere in
Beyond.  And this has indeed proven to be true.  The First Admiral of the
Comsentient Alliance, Lady Lysilph Kunseba, received her early training here,
as did Senior Scout James Steuard of Gryphon/Storm.

I-Glathriel contains the Imperium's infamous Starbase Arcturus II, commanded
by Commodore Steven vice-Aarons.  The starbase is an important link in the
Imperium's xboat route from the Vanguard Reaches through Beyond to Capital.

Unfortunately, I-Glathriel has also gained a reputation as the haven for at
least two privateer fleets, the Webrunners and the Dark Goddesses, although
the Webrunners claim to have legitimate Letters of Marque from the Zydarian
Codominium and are the only "commercial shippers" permitted within the
I'Sred*Ni Heptad--where they often seek refuge when pursued.

The I-Glathriel Subsector has 1.24 billion sentient inhabitants on 21 worlds.
Its highest tech level is E at Starbse Arcturus II, and its highest
population is 9 at Rock.

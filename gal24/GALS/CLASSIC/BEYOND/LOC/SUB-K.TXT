This subsector takes its name from the ruling race within its boundaries
and their unique seven-capitaled form of government (two of its subcapitals
actually lie within the boundaries of the Middle Beyond).  The Sred*Ni are
not overfond of granting entrance to the Heptad to Z'Sred*Ni (or
non-Sred*Ni).  As a result the Travellers' Aid Society considers the entire
subsector one large Amber Zone.  Any travel within its borders is done on
an "at your own risk" basis and neither the Imperium nor the Comsentient
Alliance will interfere with Heptad decisions regarding the punishment or
imprisonment of their citizens.

The I'Sred*Ni Heptad has 14.23 billion sentient inhabitants on 45 worlds.
Its highest tech level is E at I'Sred*Nispr, and its highest population
is 9 at I'Sred*Ni Nest, I'Sred*Nixtu, Stagatz and Rolk.

The Zydar Subsector is unique within Beyond in that it is here, at Rabanitas,
that the Grand Council of the Comsentient Alliance sits in assembly in the
Great Hall.  The Great Hall is the largest single structure in Beyond:
measuring 5.946 kilometers in length by 3.675 kilometers in width by 3.675
kilometers in height.  It contains environments suitable for each of the
races which hold either full or associate membership, or merely nominal
representation, in the Alliance.  The Assembly Chamber of the Grand Council
lies at the exact centre of the Great Hall and measures .937 kilometer in
diameter, being perfectly spherical.  Cubicles within the assembly chamber
are artificially controlled for the comfort of the sentient representatives.

The Zydar Subsector has 12.33 billion sentient inhabitants on 38 worlds.
Its highest tech level is D at Cthonia and Abchandler, and its highest
population is A at Battelle.

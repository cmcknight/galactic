System: Zydiquaryl

This system contains archives.

Archives are a repository of public, official, military, and/or historical
records.  It is usually associated with one or more of the political factions
within Beyond, although there is rumoured to be at least one Imperial archive
in die Weltbund.  (from BEYOND, Paranoia Press, 1981, p. 2).

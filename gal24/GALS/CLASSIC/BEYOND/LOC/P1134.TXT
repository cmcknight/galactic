System: Rock

This system is an IDES containment facility.

In the case of a Containment Facility, the entire world has been developed
and is being maintained as a containment facility (prison) for those adjudged
guilty of crimes against prevailing laws, customs, and/or mores.  In the
case of the Comsentient Alliance, the only crime that carries a penalty of
"containment" is that of deliberate anti-sentient activities.  Normally,
containment facilities will carry a Red Zone classification, but in any
case visits are absolutely forbidden unless authorized (or one way).

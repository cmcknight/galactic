Approximately 1,000 years ago, the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service
explored and charted Subsector Delta.  Since that time, the Imperium has
retreated coreward and its influence has been supplanted by that of the
Comsentient Alliance.  While the Alliance maintains its headquarters on
Rabanitas/Zydar, it also maintains consular offices throughout most of the
subsectors of Beyond.  A consular office is maintained at Intercourse, "the
gateway to Paradise".

Subsector Delta contains 18.34 billion inhabitants on 46 worlds.  Its highest
tech level is + at Paradise, Norstrilia and Siva and its highest population
is A at Tindalos.

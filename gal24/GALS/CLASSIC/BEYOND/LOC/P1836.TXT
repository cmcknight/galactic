System: Station Five

This system is an outpost.

An outpost is similar to an Imperial Way Station but is, of course,
non-Imperial.  The base has been established for the storage, maintenance,
refitting, and refuelling of equipment belonging to the political faction
which has final authority over the outpost or subsector.  (from BEYOND,
Paranoia Press, 1981, p. 2).

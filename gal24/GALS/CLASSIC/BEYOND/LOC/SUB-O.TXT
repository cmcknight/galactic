The Storm Subsector was named as a result of the high number of recurring
solar storms encountered by the Imperial Interstellar Scout Service team
assigned the task of exploring and charting it in 556.  Those worlds whose
primaries are most violent were aptly named with a "Storm" prefix.  The
similarity to a former IISS Scout, Storm, is purely coincidental.

Interestingly enough, the present hault-Storm rarely ventures into this
subsector, contenting himself to remain on Cahokia/I-Glathriel from where
he exercises control of Delta Research or at the LHep(Or) Colony at Delta
Centre/Metchi'Alagwa.

The Storm Subsector contains the spinward extremes of the Aslan Colonial
States as well as the rimward extreme of the I'Sred*Ni Heptad.  This entire
sector may best be described as non-industrial with several agricultural
worlds specializing in anagathic spices, exotic tobaccos, high-protein
grains, and fine wines, brandies and beer.

The Storm Subsector has 310 million sentient inhabitants on 24 worlds.  Its
highest tech level is G at Storm Centre, and its highest population is 8
at Stormpressed, Stormhold, and New Groton.

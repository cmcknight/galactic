Like most of Beyond, the Mapepire Subsector was colonized before the
"Long Night."  And like most of Beyond, it is still attempting to 
climb back to its former glories after near ruin during the last gasps
of "The Ramshackle Empire."  How well this has been accomplished in
this subsector may best be judged by the high preponderance of rich 
worlds within the fanous Mapepire Cluster.  While travel within Beyond
by Imperial citizens is discouraged by the Imperium, many still feel
the Cluster to be "the place" to see, if at all possible.

Most of the worlds within the Cluster are agricultural, as well as
rich.  And many of them are interconnected by a snake-like jump route,
which gives the Cluster and the subsector its name.

The Mapepire Subsector has 31.27 billion sentient inhabitants on 33
worlds.  Its highest tech level is F at Mapepire Balsayn, and its highest
population is A at Ip, Gul and Marketplace.

The coreward trailing corner of this subsector was selected by the Imperial
Interstellar Scout Service as the arbitrary initial survey point of Beyond
in 93 during the reign of Emperor Artemsus.  It was during the exploration
and charting of Beyond that the Exomani Hypothesis was first encountered
at Miller's Paradox in the Middle Beyond.  Miller's Paradox, at the time of
its discovery, was the home of a race of philosophers obviously evolved from
the Humaniti.  It was a contention of their Elders, the "Marcsists", that
all Humaniti had evolved elsewhere and settled Terra hundreds of thousands
of generations earlier.  Upon returning to Capital with reports of the
Exomani philosophy, the IISS Exploration Team in charge was immediately
retired and spent the remainder of their days as guests of the court of
Martin the First.

The Middle Beyond has 2.35 billion sentient inhabitants on 29 worlds.  Its
highest tech level is C at I'Sred*Nihil and I'Sred*Ni Cluster, and its
highest population is 9 at Refinnej.

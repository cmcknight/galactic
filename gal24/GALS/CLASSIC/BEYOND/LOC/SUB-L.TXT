Araniopa is fragmented into five mutually inimical political factions--an
I'Sred*Ni Heptad District in the coreward-spinward corner; a die Weltbund
Consulate at Graffin; a Zhodani Consular sub-establishment at T'Mek 4.987;
an Aslan Colonial District Protectorate centered at Nether Towley; and an
independent subsector government, rumoured to be pro-Imperium, centered at
Araniopa.

Technologically underdeveloped, it has little to offer other than danger
to the average traveller.

The Araniopa Subsector has 10.11 billion sentient inhabitants on 19 worlds.
It highest tech level is A at Araniopa and Sieve, and its highest population

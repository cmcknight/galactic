
Other Notes
-----------

Although I've referred to this galaxy as the "Classic" Traveller
Galaxy, in reality, most of the data which I ftped from Sunbane
seems to belongs to the MegaTraveller Era, a time of civil war
for the Imperium. If you are playing in the Classic Era, you may
have to adjust some of the allegiance codes to reflect that Era.

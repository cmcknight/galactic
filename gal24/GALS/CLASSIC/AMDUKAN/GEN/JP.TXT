The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Pirbarish Starlane
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Pirbarish Starlane takes its name from that of the Vilani authority
responsible for patrolling the Mendan Main prior to the collapse of the
Rule of Man.  Its capital, Lasla, was the second most important planet
in the region prior to the Julian War, and it served as a coordination
center for guerrilla resistance activity during Imperial occupation.
Although the Asimikigir Confederation has eclipsed it in importance, the
Pirbarish Starlane is still influential in the region.

No world in the Pirbarish Starlane mandates different treatment of 
Human and Vargr; however, many worlds do have institutionalized social 
segregation.

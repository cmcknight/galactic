The Julian Protectorate: Astrographical Overview
------------------------------------------------

The Julian Protectorate is a mixed-race (primarily Human and Vargr)
confederation to core-trailing of the Imperium, in what is traditionally
referred to as the Vargr Enclaves.  It encompasses all but two systems in
Amdukan sector, the trailing two-thirds of Mendan sector, the spinward third
of Arzul sector, and the coreward third of Empty Quarter sector.  Minor
presences in Antares, Star's End, Trenchans, and Ogzuekhfos sectors round
out the Protectorate proper; additionally, there are polities in Windhorn,
Meshan, and Mendan sectors which, while not members of the Protectorate,
generally coordinate policy and action with the Protectorate.

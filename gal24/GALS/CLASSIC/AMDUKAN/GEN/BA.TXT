The Julian Protectorate: Associated States: The Confederation of Bammesuka 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Confederation of Bammesuka is a weak, decentralized interstellar 
state left over from the collapse of the Second Empire of Gashikan.  
In many respects, the culture here parallels that of the Confederation 
of Mendan; however, the Confederation government does not have the 
resources to exercise control of the area, and the little control that 
it does exercise is undermined by corsairs based in the Confederation 
and by raids conducted by other corsairs based in the Sarkan 
Constellation, the Zuugabish Tripartite, and Meshan sector.

Gashikan attitudes toward Vargr are for the most part preserved here, 
and reinforced by corsair activity.  Nevertheless, weak as it is, the 
Confederation government has been attempting to moderate those 
attitudes.

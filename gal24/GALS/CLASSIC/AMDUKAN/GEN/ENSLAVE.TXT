The Julian Protectorate: The Vargr Enslavements
-----------------------------------------------

After the end of the Vargr Race Wars in -1000, tolerance for Vargr grew in
areas outside the Second Empire of Gashikan.  Vargr settlements on planets
that humans considered undesirable were accepted, provided that the Vargr
posed no threat.  Even where a threat was perceived, humans intervening
preferred to enslave the Vargr rather than exterminate them.  Inside the
Empire of Gashikan, the situation was quite different.  Vargr caught within
the Empire were invariably killed immediately.  Outside the Empire, Vargr 
slavery grew to enormous proportions, and became a dominant industry in the
area, reaching a peak around -300.  Continued Vargr immigration and the
occasional emancipation, coupled with increasingly tolerant relations between
human and Vargr, resulted around this time in a larger number of free Vargr
than those still enslaved.  Although it would remain a major industry for
quite some time, Vargr slavery began a long, slow, decline.

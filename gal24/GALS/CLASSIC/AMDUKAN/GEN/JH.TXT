The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Hhkar Sphere
--------------------------------------------------------

The Hhkar Sphere is the only member confederation of the Julian
Protectorate in which neither Human nor Vargr is the majority race.
Instead, the saurioid Hhkar dominate these planets.  The Hhkar initial
intrusion into the sector was hostile, and while the Hhkar have been
integrated into the Protectorate, there is still a good deal of
wariness about them and their intentions, and a well-staffed and
well-armed Star Legion base is maintained at Kargan as both a warning
and an insurance policy.

The Hhkar generally do not associate with other races for purposes
other than business; the most accurate Tetusu-Dene evaluation would
assign a 0 to the Hhkar Sphere, although it is felt that based on past
interactions, it would be better to assign a rating between 2 and 3.

It is a standing policy of the Hhkar Sphere that the Droyne community
on Ahbrazz is forbidden contact with non-Hhkar.  No reason for this
restriction has been given.

The Julian Protectorate: The First Resurgence: The Imperial Grand Survey
------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the late 380s through the early 400s and 410s, Imperial scouts attempted
to survey the worlds of the Protectorate for the Imperial Grand Survey.
These attempts caused concern that the information was to be used for
military or intelligence purposes, and presaged another war.  The
Protectorate "beefed up" the Star Legion and ordered it out on patrol, and
many worlds refused cooperation with the Scouts, resulting in soured
relations between the Imperium and the states of the Protectorate.  The
Imperium resorted to clandestine operations in Protectorate space, and in
spite of Protectorate efforts to prevent it, most of the area had been
surveyed to Imperial Class III standards by the time of the publication of
the Survey, in 420.

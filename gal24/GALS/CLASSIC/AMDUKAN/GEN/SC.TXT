The Julian Protectorate: Associated States: The Sarkan Constellation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The Sarkan Constellation is a remnant of the Hormine League, a former medium
sized state in Mendan Sector which collapsed due to racial tensions.  The
majority of the inhabitants of the Constellation are Vargr, but the
government, such as it is, is firmly in the hands of Humans.

For the most part, the government of the Sarkan Constellation is unable 
to enforce its will on its member planets.  Its association with the 
Julian Protectorate is in name only, and it is not unknown for corsair 
bands based here to raid Julian shipping.

In spite of the majority Vargr population, Humans dominate all aspects of
the Sarkan Constellation.  Vargr are barred from holding public office or
owning businesses.  Most public accommodations open to Vargr are considered
substandard.

The Julian Protectorate: Member States: Rar Errall
--------------------------------------------------

Rar Erral ("The Wolves' Warren") is unusual in the Protectorate, being 
a one-species state.  The entire population of the state is Vargr, with 
Urzaeng Vargr making up a significant majority.  These Vargr are 
generally refugees or the descendants of refugees from Gashikan and 
Trenchan; it is suspected, but not proven, that this state is used as a 
base for raids on planets in the Third Empire of Gashikan.

For many years, treatment of Human citizens of the Protectorate that 
entered the area was acceptable, if cold; non-Protectorate Humans were 
summarily expelled.  In recent years, even Protectorate citizens have 
been so expelled; formal protests have been repeatedly filed, and there 
is movement in the Protectorate legislature to revoke Rar Errall's 
membership in the Protectorate.  The Asimikigir Confederation and 
Commonwealth of Mendan representatives have led the countermovement, 
offering as justification the possibility of influence by example, or 
"constructive engagement".

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 2V
Violence against Humans has not been reported, but summary expulsion of 
Humans, regardless of the reason for their presence, has become common.

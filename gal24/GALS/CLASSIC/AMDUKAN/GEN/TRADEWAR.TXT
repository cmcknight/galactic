The Julian Protectorate: The Trade Wars
---------------------------------------

When Tran Menderes accepted a Vargr offer to transport Menderes goods, he
started a trend.  Other Vargr traders approached Menderes, where they were
met with a positive reception.  The resulting trade association was both
controversial and widely criticized, as was the Menderes Corporation, but
Tran Menderes stayed his course, and eventually, with Vargr technical
assistance and a mixed Human-Vargr labor force, the Menderes Corporation was
able to launch its first starship in -247.  Under the successors to Tran
Menderes, the Menderes Corporation launched and generally won half a dozen
trade wars against Kudukara Lines, and grew to connect the Vargr Extents
with the Vargr Enclaves, profiting enormously from the Vargr trade.

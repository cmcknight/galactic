The Julian Protectorate:  The Rise of the Third Imperium
--------------------------------------------------------

The rise of the Sylean Federation, and its conversion into the Third Imperium
by Cleon Zhunastu's proclamation, passed largely unnoticed in the region.
However, astute observers would realize that the proclaimed connection with
the First and Second Imperia presaged a play for Imperial dominance in the
region.  This was largely ignored until the Antarean Pacification Campaign,
in which the rimward portion of the Menderes trading sphere fell to the
expansionist forces of the Imperium.  At the same time, reports came 
filtering in that showed a lack of Imperial toleration for the Vargr, and
an apparent preference for force and intimidation rather than diplomacy and
negotiation in dealing with Vargr, at least in Corridor sector.  These
reports ignited anti-Imperial sentiment in the coreward areas of the Menderes
sphere.

The Menderes family and companies began an anti-Imperial propaganda campaign,
building common cause between Human and Vargr in resisting continued Imperial
expansion.  To Vargr, the poor treatment afforded Vargr in Corridor and other
areas of the Imperium was made the focus of the propaganda; to Humans, it was
the specter of a possible Imperial claim to the coreward portions of the 
former Ziru Sirka.  The Menderes campaign was largely successful, and when
Imperial scouts and diplomats entered the region as ambassadors of goodwill,
they were largely rebuffed.

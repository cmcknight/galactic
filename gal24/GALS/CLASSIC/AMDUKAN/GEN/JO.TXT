The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Alliance of Ozuvon
--------------------------------------------------------------

This Vargr-majority state of the Protectorate was originally formed by 
Vargr escaping from the Second Empire of Gashikan, and specifically the 
area now encompassed by the Commonwealth of Mendan.  The Vargr 
population is mixed Irilitok, Urzaeng, and Ovaghoun, with the Irilitok 
majority smaller than elsewhere in the Protectorate.  Resentment and 
hostility to Humans in general, and Humans of the Mendan Commonwealth 
in particular, are prevalent here, and on many of the worlds of the 
Alliance, Humans are treated as second-class members of society at 
best.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 5V
It is vanishingly rare for a Human to achieve any sort of Alliance-wide 
governmental post.  On many worlds, Humans have the status of 
"untouchables", and on a small number of worlds, they are held in 
servitude that is different from slavery only on paper.  Other states 
and the Protectorate itself have formally protested, but little has 
been achieved as yet.

The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Ukhanzi Coordinate
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Ukhanzi Coordinate is one of the three states that form the majority
of the so-called "Antares Crescent", an area that has historically had
close ties to the Imperial Domain of Antares.  The Ukhanzi Coordinate
differs from the other states of the region, as its relationship with the
Imperium is noticeably cooler than that of its neighbors; many of the Vargr
majority are descended from Imperial Vargr fleeing mistreatment.  The
appointment of Vargr Archdukes has affected the attitudes of Coordinate Vargr
less than those of Vargr elsewhere in the Protectorate; Coordinate Vargr
see Soegz and his successors first as part of the Imperial power structure,
and only second as Vargr.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 7V
Many Vargr in the Ukhanzi Coordinate are cautious in their relationships with
Humans; this is a legacy not of the Race Wars, as it is elsewhere in the
Protectorate, but of mistreatment of Vargr by Imperial authorities.  Tensions
have improved remarkably over the past several decades; it is entirely likely
that a reevaluation within the next few decades will raise the evaluation to
a full 8.

The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Hegemony of Lorean
--------------------------------------------------------------

The Hegemony of Lorean is one of the largest member states of the 
Protectorate, in terms of the number of member worlds, if not the 
largest.  Nevertheless, its influence in Protectorate affairs is 
limited due to lack of proximity to major trading or diplomatic 
partners (other than the Rukadukaz Republic), and its own political 
priorities involve local development.  It is one of the most active 
supporters of the Development Division of the Menderes Corporations, 
and a sizeable percentage of the Division's activities are focussed on 
the Hegemony.

The Hegemony of Lorean is the only active proponent within the 
Protectorate of pursuing relations with the K'kree outposts to 
trailing; Lorean efforts at promoting the K'kree trade have generally 
been met with disinterest by both the Protectorate and the K'kree.  
Nevertheless, promotion continues at a low level due to the potential 
that such trade has for increasing the importance, and therefore the 
influence, of the Hegemony in Protectorate affairs.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 7
Social segregation is not a matter of policy in the Hegemony; rather, 
it is a result of perceived psychological and sociological differences 
between the races.  In general, interspecies relations are amicable, 
and members of the two species will work together without incident.

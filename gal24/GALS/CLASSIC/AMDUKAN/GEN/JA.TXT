The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Asimikigir Confederation
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The region in which the Julian Protectorate lies contains the whole
range of Human-Vargr interactions, from outright hatred (in the coreward
areas, in Gashikan) to total integration (on Asimikigir itself).  The
Empires of Gashikan have historically represented the negative extreme,
where Human and Vargr will attempt to kill each other on sight.

The Asimikigir Confederation represents the other extreme, where human
and Vargr cooperate openly and willingly, and even form intimate
relationships (see "The Panet Relationship" under "Aliens of the
Protectorate"), all in a completely integrated dual-species culture.
Total equality is found throughout the Confederation, while the biological
and sociological differences between male and female, and between human
and Vargr, are fully accomodated.

The Asimikigir Confederation is also the home of the Menderes Corporations, 
the largest corporation in the Protectorate, and the only one that aspires
to megacorporate status.  The Menderes Corporation is fully diversified
and socially progressive; although it emphasizes mercantile issues over
social ones, it acts as an influence by example.  Menderes social policies,
though consistently downplayed by the company as simply good business, have
consistently been cited as the single most important contributor to the
good interrelationship that humans and Vargr have in the Confederation, and
in the rest of the Protectorate as well.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 8+
The Asimikigir Confederation is a model of interspecies cooperation.  There
is a small amount of benign and voluntary social segregation; only the fact
that, on many worlds other than Asimikigir itself, the panet relationship is
viewed with some unease prevents a full 9 rating.  On Asimikigir itself, the
Tetusu-Dene Evaluation would unquestionably be 9.

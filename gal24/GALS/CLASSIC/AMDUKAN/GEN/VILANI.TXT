The Julian Protectorate: The Ziru Sirka and the Rule of Man
-----------------------------------------------------------

At the height of Ziru Sirka dominance, most of Meshan, Mendan, and Amdukan
sectors were under the control of the Vilani Makhidarun bureau, with some
control of the Mendan Main and its surrounds shared with other bureaux.
These areas, along with the rest of the Ziru Sirka, fell under the control
of the Rule of Man at the conclusion of the Interstellar Wars, but even
before that time, the area served to attract Solomani traders.  The influx
of Solomani traders increased during the Rule of Man, and their experience
and familiarity with the area came to the notice of Emperor Hiroshi II, who
appointed such individuals to planetary administration, replacing the
military administration of the area.

In addition to the appointment of experienced traders as planetary
governors, a Solomani development company, Scorpion, in cooperation with
the Vilani Sharurshid bureau, recruited colonists for the development of
the Antarean region.  These two factors contributed to a vibrant, thriving
region which prospered while the rest of the empire decayed.

The Julian Protectorate: The Third Resurgence: The Second Imperial Survey
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

As with the original Grand Survey in the 380s to 410s, the Second Survey
prompted fears of espionage directed at a possible war to incorporate the
Protectorate area into the Imperium.  While the Imperium did not resort as
heavily to clandestine operations as during the Grand Survey, and relied
more on diplomacy, there were nevertheless some incidents between the Star
Legion and clandestine Scout operations that contributed to the damaging
of relations with the Imperium.

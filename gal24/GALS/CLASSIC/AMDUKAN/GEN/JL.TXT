The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Lumda Dower
-------------------------------------------------------

The three planets of the Lumda Dower are ruled by a constitutional monarchy
in which both humans and Vargr play an important part.  While the Lord of
Lumda, the head of the executive branch, is always a male human (though his
heir is a member of his wife's family), the judiciary is entirely in the
hands of Dower Vargr, and the legislature is bicameral, with each species
holding one chamber.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 7H
While there is no mandatory segregation of Human from Vargr in the Lumda
Dower, social patterns indicate that many members of both species are
uncomfortable among the other.  While this is not unnatural, it is exhibited
in the Lumda Dower to a greater extent than in other member states.

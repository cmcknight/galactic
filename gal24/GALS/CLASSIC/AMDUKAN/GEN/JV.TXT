The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Vugurar Dominion
------------------------------------------------------------

The Vugurar Dominion is a Vargr-majority state.  Its representatives in
the Protectorate Council tend to be outspoken on every issue, although
they are firmly committed to the principles of the Protectorate.  Many
of the most vocal advocates for Vargr equality throughout the region
are Vugurar citizens; there is a strong sensitivity in the Dominion to
anti-Vargr prejudice.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 8
The race-consciousness of the Dominion has led to a very strong set of anti-
prejudice laws.  Overcoming residual hesitancy about strong integration on
the Asimikigir model is a major goal of the Dominion government; much of the
government-created entertainment is either set on Asimikigir or in the
Asimikigir Confederation, or is centered on Asimikigir citizens traveling in
the Dominion.  In either case, it is not unusual for a panet relationship to
be prominent in the story.

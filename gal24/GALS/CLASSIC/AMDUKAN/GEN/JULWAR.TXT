The Julian Protectorate: The Julian War
---------------------------------------

The diplomatic overtures from 166 on being unproductive, in 175, Emperor
Martin I ordered Imperial fleets into Mendan sector, in an effort to 
accomplish by force what couldn't be accomplished by negotiation.

The region was divided into a number of small polities, but these rallied
to the Asimikigir Confederation, the Menderes Corporation and family, and
in particular Julian Menderes, the family head, when he became Regent of
the Asimikigir Confederation in 178.  Julian commanded the respect and
loyalty of both humans and Vargr in the Confederation, and he proved an
able leader as well.  Taking advantage of Vargr resourcefulness and human
determination, Julian Menderes was able to create a protectorate organization
whose military arm, the Star Legion, was able to repulse the Imperial forces
by 185, and to capture most of the Antares region by 191, when the Imperium
was forced to come to a formal peace agreement.

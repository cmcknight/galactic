The Julian Protectorate: Member States: The Commonwealth of Mendan
------------------------------------------------------------------

The Commonwealth of Mendan is the only Member State of the Protectorate
that was originally part of the Second Empire of Gashikan.  Of the states
on or near the Mendan Main, it is second in influence and political power
only to the Asimikigir Confederation.

The Commonwealth of Mendan is the conservative voice in the Protectorate
Council, urging restraint in relations with other states, and generally
arguing against expansion of the Protectorate.

Internally, while the Commonwealth accepts the principle of equality
between Vargr and Human, some residual race hatred between the species
still exists, and Human and Vargr are found together or in cooperative
arrangements less often than elsewhere in the Protectorate.  These 
attitudes are changing, however slowly, and the extent of the change
explains to a great extent why the Commonwealth chose to affiliate itself
with the Protectorate rather than with the strongly anti-Vargr Third
Empire of Gashikan.

Tetusu-Dene Evaluation: 6H
Many worlds of the Commonwealth of Mendan rate a full 7; there are as many
that do not.  No world in the Commonwealth prohibits Vargr participation in
government, but institutionalized discrimination remains a major social
influence in the Commonwealth.

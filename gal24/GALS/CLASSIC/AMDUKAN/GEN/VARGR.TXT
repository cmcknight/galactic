The Julian Protectorate: The Coming of the Vargr
------------------------------------------------

As the Rule of Man decayed, Vargr settlers, who had obtained Jump drive 
from the Vilani in Corridor and Windhorn sectors, finally rounded the 
coreward end of the Windhorn Rift and entered the area.  While initial
reaction was positive (the Vargr were viewed as a potentially useful
resource), raiders and corsairs inevitably followed, and just as inevitably,
conflict between human and Vargr resulted.  This conflict did little to
build trust between the races, but remained relatively low-key until the
spark of the Sack of Gashikan.

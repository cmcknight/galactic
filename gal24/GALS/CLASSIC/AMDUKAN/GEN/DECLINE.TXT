The Julian Protectorate: The Decline of the Protectorate
--------------------------------------------------------

With peace between the Protectorate and the Imperium, the Protectorate's
defensive alliance against the Imperium waned as a binding force between
the members.  Members went their own way in foreign relations and trade,
with the Protectorate doing little more than establishing standards for
interoperation (to ensure that, if the Star Legion were again needed, 
maintenance and communication between various worlds' and confederations'
detachments would not suffer).

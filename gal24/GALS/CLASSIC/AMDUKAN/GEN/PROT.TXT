The Julian Protectorate: The Julian Protectorate Forms
------------------------------------------------------

With the peace treaty in 191, Julian Menderes was able to convert 
the wartime protectorate organization into a permanent authority, the 
Julian Protectorate, with the Star Legion as its armed forces.  This change
was more nominal than actual, as its primary purpose is to resist Imperial
expansion, rather than act as a governing state.  As part of the peace
agreement of 191 with the Imperium, a cluster of worlds in Antares sector
was granted autonomy as the League of Antares, and Julian Menderes was able
to ensure that the people in positions of power were from families that had
come coreward as refugees during the Pacification Campaigns.  The cluster is
today largely sympathetic to the Protectorate, and, although Imperial
domination of the cluster is complete, no attempt to revoke autonomy or to
reintegrate the cluster by force has been made, largely because of the 
certainty of a response from the Protectorate.

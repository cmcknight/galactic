
Amdukan Sector - Credits
------------------------

The star names and UWP data were created by the HIWG. The Hhkar are
from Challenge 52. Much of the information on the Julian Protectorate
is adapted from _Vilani_and_Vargr_, Digest Group Publications, and from
information on Mendan Sector in Challenge 49, Game Designer's Workshop.
Jeff Zeitlin (jeff.zeitlin@execnet.com) converted the sector to Galactic
format in 1997.

Frontier Worlds Subsector
-------------------------
Though still on the border of the Imperium, the Frontier Worlds subsector has
been settled and developed for several centuries. Interstellar trade is
increasing and exploitation of sub-optimal worlds is beginning. Naval bases
are maintained at a high degree of readiness due to the constant threat of
armed incursion from the Sydymic Empire.

The Frontier Worlds subsector contains 31 worlds with a total population of
31.8 billion. The highest population level is A, at Westcutt; the highest
tech levell is C at Bastian and Alameth.

Sydymic Empire Subsector
------------------------
Only Arodites in this subsector owes allegiance to the Imperium, all other
worlds being claimed or disputed by the Sydymic Empire. The Sydymites are
another minor variant of Humans, distinguished primarily by an average height
of 2.4 meters (8 feet). First contacted on their homeworld of Sopater in
-2174 Imperial (2347 AD), these folk soon spread throughout the subsector.
Employed principally as soldiers and technicians, the Sydymites took the
opportunity duringt the collapse of the Rule of Man to become independent.
Minor clashes with Imperial forces took place over the next several millenia
as the developed their own culture and tchnology. Major expansion and the
declared establishment of the Sydymic Empire took place while the Imperium was
otherwise occupied by the Civil War. Temporary accomodation has been reached
but it appears most likely that there will be further clashes.

This subsector has 27 worlds with a total population of 24.04 billion. The
highest population is 9, at Urias, Rechah, and Achbor; the highest tech level
is B, at Arodites and Sopater.

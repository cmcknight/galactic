Outworld Subsector
------------------
The Outworlds subsector is an area of new exploration. This region is
administered from Sledgetower as a protectorate although several worlds have
applied for Imperial membership. Claims are still being adjudicated since the
political situation in the adjacent Tri-Empire subsector is still unresolved.
Many of the worlds have only been hastily surveyed.

The Outworlds subsector consists of 36 worlds with a total population of 1.2
million. The highest population level is 5, at Oberitis and Bledisan; the
highest tech level is 9, at Annuis, Monad, Dawnlord, and Emira.

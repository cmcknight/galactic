Ikhnaton Subsector
------------------
Initial entry into the Ley sector was made in the Ikhnaton subsector during
-2045 Imperial (2476AD) in the Rule of Man. This rich subsector retained its
political cohesion in a loose confederation during the Long Night and
voluntarily joined the Third Empire. It experienced some turmoil and damage
to trade and industry during the Civil War but has quickly recovered.

Jullanar is the residence of Alanir Kimar Re'Donan, Duke of the Ley sector
and serves as both sector and subsector capital. Important naval yards here
are responsible for the upkeep of the sector fleet. Some new construction is
also accomplished here.

The Ikhnaton subsector contains 38 worlds with a total population of 223.9
billion. The highest population level is A, at Kerim, Efrit, Delgalish,
Aberlore, and Dragonmist; the highest tech level is C, at Jullanar,
Dragonmist, and Ihnyssas.

Outreaumer Subsector
--------------------
This subsector serves as a communications link to the often troubled border
regions of Thorstone and Tr-Empire. Worlds in this area were settled primarily
by colonists from the Ikhnation subsector. Each planet was taken by a
different political or religious group. During the time of troubles,
communications were lost and all worlds regressed to tech levels of four and
under. Incorporation into the Imperium has been directed primarily by a cadet
branch of the Ley Family, currently headed by Anselm deLey, Count of Tancred
at the subsector capital of Arsouf.

Because of the threat of the Syndymic Empire, naval bases are maintained at a
fairly high level of readiness and the subsector navies maintain an active
patrol schedule.

The Outreaumer subsector contains 21 worlds with a population of 323 million.
The highest populations are 8, at Sidon, Tancred, and Jaffa; the highest tech
level is C, at Ascalon.

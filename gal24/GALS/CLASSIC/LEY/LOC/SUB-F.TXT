Guadix Drift Subsector
----------------------
Two X-boat routes through this subsector connect the important Frontier
subsector Titanstorm with the sector capital in Ikhnation subsector and the
Spearhead subsector with the Frontier Worlds subsector. The latter is the
defensive bulwark against expansion by the Syndymic Empire.

The Guadix Drift subsector contains 31 worlds with a total population of
12.426 billion. The highest population is A, at Helena; the highest tech
level is C, at Gheelis and Alderniss. All worlds in this subsector are
members of the Imperium with the exception of Drelis.

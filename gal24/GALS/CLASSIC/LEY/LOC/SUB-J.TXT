Matarishan Federation Subsector
-------------------------------
Originally settled by refugees fleeing the collapse of the Rule of Man in
-1770 Imperial (2751AD), the Matarishan Federation was a short-lived attempt
at political stability and expansion after the Civil War, the local inhabitants
violently resisted reincorporation into the Imperium. Military pressure soon
broke the resistance movement. Political resentment requires that the Imperium
keep a larger force than normal in the area to enforce stability.

The Matarishan Federation subsector contains 23 worlds with a total population
of 23.21 billion. The highest population is A, at Abishai and Gorget; the
highest tech level is C, at Barkis. All worlds in the Matarishan Federation
subsector are members of the Imperium with the exception of Bilhan.

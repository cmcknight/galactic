Osiris Deep Subsector
---------------------
Located in the Lesser Rift, the Osiris Deep subsector is administered from
Starbridge. None of the worlds in this region are members of the Imperium
although Shanidar has made an application. Scoutships based a Shanidar
maintain a watch throughout the subsector, though little activity other than
mining goes on. Forerunner artifacts have recently been found in this region,
prompting the local Imperial beauracracy to order a thorough re-survey of the
subsector.

The Osiris Deep subsector contains 10 worlds with a total population of 10.48
million. The highest population is 7, at Shenidar; the highest tech level is
A, at Anaharan, Zapotec, and Shantunia.

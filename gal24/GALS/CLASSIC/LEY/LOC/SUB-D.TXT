Zagrathian Subsector
--------------------
The Zagrathian subsector lies entirely within the Lesser Rift and is
comprised entirely of worlds which are not members of the Imperium. The low
number of systems in this area and the poor quality of the worlds located
there have led to little Imperial activity here. Several companies do exploit
this region and it is under the nominal protection of Imperial forces. The
subsector is administered from Wolfstar.

The Zagrathian subsector contains 9 worlds with a total population of 304
thousand. The highest population is 5, at Walgrave; the highest tech level is
A, at Hagolton and Dorawet.

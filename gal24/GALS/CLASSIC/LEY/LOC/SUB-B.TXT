Nightmare Subsector
-------------------
The Nightmare subsector borders on the Lesser Rift. Active expansion and
exploration in this direction ended centuries ago and worlds in this region
show considerable development. Naval bases are maintained along the edge of
the Imperial border as well as the X-boat links. Trade is active in this
subsector with considerable starship traffic. All worlds in this subsector
are Imperium members or unihabited protectorates.

The Nightmare subsector contains 37 worlds with a total population of 155.7
billion. The highest population is A, at Camsteris, Kizator, Dornis, and
Dramelian; the highest tech level is C, at Flamgard, Evereve, Deepwar, and
Dramelian.

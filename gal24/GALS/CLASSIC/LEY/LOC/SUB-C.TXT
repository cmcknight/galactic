Noir Deep Subsector
-------------------
A frontier region with few resources to interest the Imperium. Noir Deep
subsector has seen little development. Naval forces maintained a strong
patrol force here until recently whe population buildup and starship traffic
became such that local planetary forces could maintain the watch. Frequent
rumours of rich mineral strikes in this subsector have proved to be unfounded.
Forerunner artifacts have been found though in the Menanon System. Imperial
scientists are investigating.

The Noir Deep subsector contains 10 worlds with a total population of 100
million. The highest population level is 8, at Howarth; the highest tech
level is 8, also at Howarth.

Admistered from Wolfstar, none of the worlds in this subsector are Imperium
members but all are under Imperial protection.

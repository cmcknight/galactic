Highlord Subsector
------------------
The Highlord subsector maintained a degree of stability during the Civil War
and thus did not regress significantly. Of importance for its own industrial
products, it also has an X-boat route linking with the Noir Deep subsector,
the sheild against Sydymic expansion. All systems in the subsector are either
Imperium members or undeveloped protectorates.

The Highlord subsector contains 28 worlds with a total population of 34.2
billion. The highest population level is A, at Towermorn, Gravemark, and Onud;
the highest tech level is C, at Towermorn, Persifaris, and Warlock.

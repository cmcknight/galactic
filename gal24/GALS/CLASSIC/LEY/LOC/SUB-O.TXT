Diamond-Prince Subsector
------------------------
The Diamond-Prince subsector is the region where active expansion and
colonisation is proceeding in the Ley sector. Most planets in this subsector
are either members of the Imperium or have applied for membership. Expansion
is directed towards the adjacent Outworlds subsector. Exploration into the
Tri-Empire subsector has been officially discouraged but rumors have it that
extensive clandestine activity is taking place there.

The Diamond-Prince subsector consists of 32 worlds with a total population of
5.46 billion. The highest population level is 9, at Sledgetower; the highest
tech level is B, also at Sledgetower.

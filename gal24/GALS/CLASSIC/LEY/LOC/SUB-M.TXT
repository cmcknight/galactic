Satyressia Subsector
--------------------
The Satyressia subsector is an open frontier of the Imperium, no other
political entity having any claim to it. Colonisation in this area is
encouraged, several groups of political dissidents having established new
settlements. Naval and Scout bases in this area are maintained at a relatively
low level of preparedness due to the low probability of hostile activity.
Imperial surveys indicate a relative abundance of mineral resources. Long term
plans schedule this subsector for industrial development several centuries
from now.

The Satyressia subsector contains 27 worlds with a total population of 10.15
million. The highest population is 8, at Goldfault; the highest tech level is
C, at Bornelos.

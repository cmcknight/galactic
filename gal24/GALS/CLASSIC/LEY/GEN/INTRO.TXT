Introduction to the Ley Sector
------------------------------

The Ley Sector was developed by Judges Guild in 1980. It was declared
invalid by GDW in 1984.

Since the sector was produced before it became common practice to give
population multipliers, number of planetoid belts, or number of gas giants in
sector data, these numbers have been left as 0, except with gas giants where 0
indicates the absence of any and 1 indicates the presence of an indeterminate
number. There were also a few subsectors where it was possible to have a
reasonable guess at population multipliers. These have also been included.

Whilst transcribing the data I have tried to preserve as much of the feel of
the original product as possible. Please bear in mind that the Ley Sector
was published in the early eighties, and as such is far 'rougher' than the
sectors which are published today. In transcribing the data, I found many
examples where the planetary data conflicted with the accompaning text. I have
made no attempt to correct these conflicts.

Update (17-July-97): Added random population multipliers (where popmult
originally equaled 0) on recommendation from one of the users. Worlds with
pop=0, law=0, and gov=0 got to keep their original popmult=0.   -jimv

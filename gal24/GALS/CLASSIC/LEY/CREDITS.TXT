
The Ley Sector is copyright 1980 by Judges Guild.

No individual authors are listed, but the artwork is credited to Ken
Simpson, and it is likely that the design was done by Dave Sering who
was credited with the design of most of the other Judges Guild sectors.
Bob Bledsaw (judgesguild@q-com.com) gave permission for this sector to
be transcribed into Galactic (as well as other Traveller-related
freeware). The transcription was done by Andrew Moffatt-Vallance
(a.vallance@netaccess.co.nz) in 1997.

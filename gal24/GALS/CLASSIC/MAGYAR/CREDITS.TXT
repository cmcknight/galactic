
Magyar - Credits
----------------

The original data for this version of the Magyar sector was ftped from
the Sunbane archives.  Since only one subsector was fully named in
that version (subsector N, "Bobbo"), I have added my own subsector and
system names for the rest of the data, except that I also made sure
the names for subsectors D, H, L, & P agreed with the data in
Supplement 10: The Solomani Rim. I've also added jump routes, alien
races, some history and information on trade routes and shipping
lines, as well as the types of military bases found in the sector.
Once again though, I would like to point out that I am NOT responsible
for naming a subsector "Bobbo!" :)

In connecting the borders of the Solomani Rim to Magyar, I was able
to keep almost all the same jump routes across the border, although
in several cases the direction had to be changed.  I did have to
make two noncanonical changes to the SOLOMANI RIM to make sense
of the data:

1. I added a jump route from Jardin-Theseus into the Morency subsector.
2. I added a jump route from Albadawi-Beal into the Fugue subsector.

Jim tells me that Magyar was covered in one of the Traveller
Chronicles, but I have not had the opportunity to see that issue. 
If anyone could send me a copy, I'll revise this version in
accordance with the published material. 

In creating Magyar sector, I had to ignore the data generated by Andy
House's "Imperial Scout Service Guide to the Universe."  I did so
because it disagreed with both the Sunbane data and the very limited
information on Magyar in the Solomani Rim supplement.

If anybody has additions to Magyar, please send them to either Jim or
I so that we can add them to the present data.  Thanks!

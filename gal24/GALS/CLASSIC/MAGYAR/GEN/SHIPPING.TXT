                    TRADE IN MAGYAR SECTOR

The Ockian Ring of Worlds is one of three major trade routes within
this sector.  Each of these routes is a circular path or run over
which travel a variety of lines.  The Ockian Ring and the Keyor Run
are the two small runs, and are used by many traders.  The largest
of the three runs is the Blackjack-Ramanian circuit, which only the
megacorps have the resources and connections to milk adequately.
Nevertheless, Magyar is an excellent sector for the enterprising 
free trader, with many short jumps and a large number of worlds
where the law level is neglible.

Imperium regions of Magyar are served by Solar Shipping, based out
of Terra in the Solomani Rim, as well as the megacorps of Ling
Standard Products and Naasirka.  Confederation regions of Magyar
are served by Transstar megacorp (based out of Jardin in the
Solomani Rim), especially in subsectors K, L, N, O, & P. [SOURCE: 
Book 7, Merchant Prince, p. 12]  Two other well-established but
sector-wide companies are McKillen Lines (based out of Uebelhor)
and Vandok Shipping (based out of Ock).  There is also an
aggressive fledgling company called Overthrust Inc. (based out of
Keyor).

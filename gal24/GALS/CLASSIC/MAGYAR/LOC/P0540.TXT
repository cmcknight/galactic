Ziarko     A201001-E     W   Rs Ic Lo Ni Va            -- Dakin Burdick (9/96)

Ziarko is a mystery to most visitors.  A nearly barren vacuum world boasts
an excellent starport with ultramodern facilities and a fairly heavy
traffic in vessels without being on a Confederation trade route.  Besides
all of that, there are very few full-time residents of the planet; these
being the staff of the starport!

The only thing that can be found on Ziarko are orange-colored Jakaso
crystals, and it is against Ziarko law to gather any of these crystals.

The Jakaso crystals are alive, sentient, and highly psionic.  The
Jakaso themselves have also been recently found to lay "eggs", which
appear as small simple teardrops of crystal.

The local residents have organized the foundation of the starport 
as a cover for the establishment of a psionic institute.  It receives
part of its funding from the Uebelhor Psychic Institute, which in
turn is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Overthrust Inc., although the
local researchers and psionic students of the Jakaso do not yet
realize it.  Overthrust's board of directors plan to contract the
services of the Jakaso crystals to the Confederation Navy as 
Intelligence agents, but has not yet determined how to go about doing
this.

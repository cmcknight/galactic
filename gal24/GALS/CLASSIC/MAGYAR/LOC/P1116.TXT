Nishikiori     C455868-A                               -- Dakin Burdick (9/96)

Nishikiori is ruled by Icenogle via an army of police robots and warbots.
The amount of wealth funnelled to Icenogle is not oppressive, and Icenogle
does provide order on planet, so the natives of Nishikiori have not yet
been driven to revolt.

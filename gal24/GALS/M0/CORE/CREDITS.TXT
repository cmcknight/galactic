If I recall correctly, Idiot/Savant <idiot@sans.vuw.ac.nz>
sent me this version of the Core Sector, not necessarily
for inclusion into Galactic, but just for advice on how
to fix some things that were going wrong with it. I went
ahead and included it even though it's far from being in
a finished state. -jimv

Subject: Year 0 Core sector now available

A side project I've been working on.  I have input core sector from M:0
into a Gal2.3 file. 

Implemented in the data are:
Volker's Core Sector Corrections
Some personal corrections based on CT Core sector Data
Chanestin Kingdom and Interstellar Confederacy worlds hilighted
Sylean Federation Worlds hilighted, data from CT used
Santry and Cordova placed using Jo Grant's TML suggeestions.
Barren Worlds hilighted in grey, and are not included in any polity
Barren worlds which had a Scout base upgraded to D clss starport, given
1d3 population and 1d6 pop multi. Scout bases are only present on world
with type 'D' or better starports according to the rules.

The worlds selected for the CK and IC are based on worlds mentioned by
Volker, which in turn were refrenced from Traveller Digests, and by the
M:0 information.  The Ck had up to 25 worlds, the IC 32.  Most worlds
follow a main.  Barren worlds were not included.

In all a rather decent sector.  And its a compatible Gal2.3 directory.

Go to my new FTP site.  http://www.magicnet.net/~cmdrx/ftp  the file is
year0.zip.  Download and unzip it. place the year0 directory in your
Gal2.3 directory.  You will have to edit the gal.lst file to include the
year0 directory.  Once thats done, you have the whole of core sector
ready for play.

Introduction to the Universal World Profile Editor
--------------------------------------------------

The UWP Editor is intended to make editing specific worlds and
non-worlds less of a chore.


When Editing Worlds:
--------------------

The UWP Editor's chief advantage over a more conventional editor
is that you can see the UWP stat definitions change in front of
your eyes as you change the stats themselves. Likewise, there is
a field colored in red showing the computed trade codes, and
these trade codes change automatically as you modify the UWP
stats, thus saving you the time of working them out by hand. You
can even copy the computed trade codes over to the notes section
of the world you are editing by simply hitting the <F2> key, but
beware that you might wipe out certain notes which are not
computed, such as subsector capital designations, for example.

You can use the right/left arrows and the <Tab> key to move the
"cursor", and if you are on a UWP digit, you can change it to the
next higher or lower value by using the up/down arrows. It is
also worth noting that alphanumeric keys are active, so that if
you are at the starport digit and wish to change it to a "Class
A" facility, simply hitting the <A> key will accomplish this.
The <space bar> will wipe out the entry of a given column,
except for the 1st, which must always contain something. If you
want to wipe out a world's name, just put a "." in the first
column, and wipe out the rest of the name with spaces.

The <F1> key toggles the method which the program uses to compute
the trade codes. The "official" method, which is assumed when the
program is first executed, uses the trade classification table in
the MegaTraveller rules. However, during the course of writing
Galactic's sector generator, I provided an alternate "homebrew"
method for world generation which, in part, modified the
MegaTraveller system by dropping the Rich, Poor, Industrial,
Nonindustrial, and Non-agricultural trade codes. Two additional
modifications were that water worlds may be agricultural and that
fluid (non-water) oceans would not exist on worlds without an
exotic, corrosive, or insidious atmosphere.

Here is an example world to illustrate the UWP format used by
this software:

#--------1---------2---------3---------4---------5---------6---
#PlanetName   Loc. UPP Code   B   Notes         Z  PBG Al LRX *
#----------   ---- ---------  - --------------- -  --- -- --- -
Thorp         2638 A671761-B  N                    900 Io 08N fxh
                   ||||||| |  |                 |  ||| |  ||| |||
         Starport -+|||||| |  +- Military Base  |  ||| |  ||| ||+- Hide (H,h, )
        World Size -+||||| |       Travel Zone -+  ||| |  ||| |+- Map (x,y,z, )
         Atmosphere -+|||| +- Technology Level     ||| |  ||| +- Attach (f,m, )
       Hydrographics -+|||  Population Multiplier -+|| |  ||+- Export
            Popultion -+||         Planetoid Belts -+| |  |+- Resource Level
            Government -+|               Gas Giants -+ |  +- Indigenous Life
              Law Level -+                 Allegiance -+

Notes:
   Travel Zone: <space>=green, A=amber, B=blue, R=red
   Life, Resource, Export: These are all part of the homebrew system
      and are only active when the "homebrew" method is in use.
   Attach: A file (f) or a menu (m) may be attached to the hex to
      give more detail about the world in question.
   Map: Maps may be attached as well. In such cases, an "x" in this
      position signifies that a world map is attached. "y" denotes a
      map of the star system. "z" indicates both sorts of maps.
   Hide: The world may also be hidden. "h" signifies a weak hide
      (most of the stats are hidden from the user). "H" signifies a
      strong hide (not even the world name will appear on the map,
      although the marker signifying its presence will still be drawn).


When Editing Non-Worlds:
------------------------

Non-worlds are anything that's not a world. Common examples include
deep space research and refueling stations, derelict spacecraft that
happened to misjump far away from any star system, astronomical
curiosities such as neutron stars or black holes, and even nebulas.

The arrows and tab function in much the same manner as before,
however, the format for non-worlds is very different. Here is
an example:


#--------1---------2---------3---------4---------5---------6---
#PlanetName   Loc. UPP Code   B   Notes         Z  PBG Al LRX *
#----------   ---- ---------  - --------------- -  --- -- --- -
Derelict      2836 *3 Abandoned Vessel          R      Io     f H
                   ||                           |      |      | |
         Asterisk -++- Marker (1,2,3,4)         |      |      | +- Hide (H,h, )
  (signifies this                  Travel Zone -+      |      +- Attach (f,m, )
  as a non-world)                          Allegiance -+

Notes:
   Marker: 1=triangle, 2=square, 3=diamond, 4=lots-o-dots
   Attach: f=file, m=menu
   Map: Generally speaking, non-worlds don't have maps
   Hide: H=strong, h=soft (strong hide will hide both the name
      as well as the marker, while a soft hide will hide only
      the explanation... in this case "Abandoned Vessel")


Hope you enjoy the program, and if you find any bugs or have
suggestions for new features, please write.

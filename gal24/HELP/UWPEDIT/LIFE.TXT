
   Life Stat Explained
   -------------------
   0: Sterile: No indigenous life. Atmosphere is not breathable
         without substantial eco-engineering.
   1: Proto-cellular: Indigenous life consisted of amino acids
         and/or various primitive replicators. These may have
         been wiped out by transplanted organisms.
   2: Single-cellular: Transplants would have taken over.
   3: Multi-cellular: Transplants would have taken over.
   4: Complex microscopic: Lots of colorful ooze. Transplants
         would have taken over for the most part, however, there
         might be some indigenous bacteria still competing.
   5: Macroscopic: Mainly small indigenous sea-life which would
         be competing along side whatever transplants are
         present.
   6: Primitive ecosystem: Oceans are teaming with indigenous
         organisms, but land-based life is just carving out its
         niche. Transplants may have halted the advance of
         indigenous life, assuming the two are bio-compatible.
   7: Teaming ecosystem: Water/Land/Air-based herbivores and
         predators. Transplants would have a hard time competing
         in such an advanced ecosystem. Bio-compatibility would
         be an important issue.
   8: Proto-sentient: Tool-fabrication, mastery of fire.
   9: Sentient: Agriculture, language, symbology.
   A: Non-spacefaring: Planet may be a biological protectorate
         (ala the Prime Directive).
   B: Early Spacefaring: Indigenous race may have been given
         technology or may even have been genetically uplifted.
   C: Cataclysm: Result of either war, plague, or minor
          environmental mismanagement. Survivors are in a state
          of slow recovery.
   D: Green Hell: Result of major environmental mismanagement.
          World is transformed into a greenhouse.

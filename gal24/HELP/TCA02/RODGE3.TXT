Subject: Stuart: DGP COPYRIGHTS

Dear Stuart and TML'ers,
 
I wrote a  detailed letter about DGP's  copyright policies on TML
awhile back  (with which Marc Miller  concurred), but there still
seems  to be  some lingering  confusion concerning  the matter in
public  Traveller  discussions,  so  I'll  clarify  the situation
again.  I think you are going to love this:
 
MARC  MILLER HAS  DGP'S PERMISSION  to use  background data  (UWP
lists,  planet names,  sector  maps,  etc.) from  DGP's Traveller
works  in  any  way  that  he  sees  fit  in  printed Traveller 4
publications!
 
In addition, Marc  Miller has been given a free  hand to dip into
DGP's Traveller archives for inspiration in developing background
material for  his new incarnation  of the Traveller  role-playing
game. This way, he can keep  Traveller 4 consistent with what has
come before!!!
 
The  races  (the  Geonee,  the  Brinn,  etc.), the places (Vland,
Shudusham,  Capital), and  the things  (robots, equipment,  etc.)
which  you loved  from DGP's   works still  exist in  the overall
Traveller  milieu.  I  don't  believe  Marc  has any intention of
changing this  (he's DGP's number  one fan!).
 
Traveller has been around a long time, and it would be a shame to
invalidate the thousands of pages  that have been written for the
milieu. Marc knows what he's doing, and he knows what you love. A
lot of  what has come before  will not exist in  Milieu Zero, but
the future has not been erased. ;)
 
And the best years are yet to come.
 
Sincerely,
 
Roger Sanger

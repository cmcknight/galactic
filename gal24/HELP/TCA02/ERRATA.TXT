I made errata sheets for my local stores as well, but before I 
distributed them I called Ken Whitman and asked whether it was OK to do 
so.  He said it was, so long as the standard copyright and trademark 
notices were included, and the sheet was provided free of charge, and 
never sold.

So, that's all you need to do to be all legal-like, as far as IG is 
concerned.

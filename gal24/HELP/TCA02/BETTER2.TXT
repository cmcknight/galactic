Yes. Which one?

I'm talking about sector data in general, as I thought I'd made
clear in a few of my past emails to you. Data for any sector of
any time period. All the sector data that was published in the
past and all that will be published in the future. I know, it's
a rather sweeping question, but it needed asking. Judging from
what I've heard so far, so long as the program is distributed
free of charge and acknowledges the copyright holders and the
Traveller trademark, then everything is okay, right?

Roger: Your piece was very well crafted and I agree.

Jim: Since I agree with what Roger said, then I think it forms a
great answer for you.

Thanks for the quick response this time. I think this issue is
finally settled to everyone's satisfaction. You have certainly
proven worthy of the high praises people have sung about you on
the TML (somewhat to my surprise). I hope the successes of T4
and any successive editions do nothing to change your pro-gamer
philosophies or your good manners when dealing with the smallfry.
Pleasure talking to you...   jimv@empirenet.com

Dear Traveller Afficionados,
 
I've  noticed some  speculation over  the past  few weeks  on the
mailing lists pertaining to DGP's future role in Traveller, and I
thought you might appreciate an update...
 
DGP has been  in negotiations with the managers  of Traveller for
almost 10 months. Those guys sure are busy.
 
Even though  I'm not as enthusiastic  as I was 10  months ago, it
looks like a deal may be able to be worked out. Keep your fingers
crossed.
 
We are seeking  a renewal of DGP's Traveller  license, so that we
can rerelease  our extensive Traveller archives  in various forms
as  well as  produce brand  new Traveller  works for  your gaming
pleasure. We love  sci-fi, and we look forward  to being involved
in Traveller development once again  and working with Marc Miller
and Imperium Games.
 
Wish us luck!
 
I'll keep you posted.
 
Sincerely (floating somewhere in limbo),
 
    Rodge

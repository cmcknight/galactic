   Business started 1994 by the officers.  50% of capital stock

owned by John Benitz.

employed by Prudential Bache Securities Asia Pacific, Hong Kong.

OTHER SIGNIFICANT INFORMATION

   There is a TSR connection.  Sweetpea Entertainment owns the 
rights to the screenplay of "Dungeons & Dragons: The Movie".
Since Ken Whitman (and others at IG) are former TSR employees,
this might explain how they came together originally.

   Here is what I found about the movie, from a FAQ file on the Internet:

     "The movie & merchandizing rights to a Dungeons & Dragons movie have
    been bought by Sweetpea Entertainment.  They are aiming at a 
    production cost of $50 million and a release date somewhere around
    Christmas of 1996 or summer of 1997.  The movie will be a combination 
    of live action and computer animation.  Stan Winston, the man
    behind the digital effects in _Terminator II_ and _Jurassic Park_,
    has been brought in to aid Sweetpea with the movie.  The script, 
    which was written by Topper Lilien and Carrol Cartwright and is 
    apparently not based on a specific TSR product, involves an 
    inexperienced sorceress and a quick-witted rogue who are on a quest 
    to find an artifact which could control gold dragons and to keep 
    said artifact out of the hands of the villain, who happens to be a 
    wizard.  Stay tuned to rgfd for any further announcements about this 
    movie."

   This implies that while the information from D&B I found on Sweetpea 
shows only has four employees, that number may not reflect private
contractors or temporary employees brought in to work on the production
of the film.

FINAL ANALYSIS

   Sweetpea Entertainment is a small, private corporation that was 
founded less than three years ago and is involved primarily in the film 
industry.  As such, it is difficult (but apparently not totally impossible)
to find out information about them.

   How they came about funding the resurrection of Traveller 
would I'm sure make an interesting story, should Mr. Solomon and/or 
Mr. Benitz like to tell us about it some day.  At this point we can only
speculate as to why.

   I welcome any comments from the gallery....

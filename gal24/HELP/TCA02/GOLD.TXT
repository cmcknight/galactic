Date: Mon, 08 Jul 96 02:49:56 GMT

  We have been apporached by the good folks at Imperium Games concerning
GRG publishing licensed material for the new "Traveller" RPG! I spoke with Ken
Whitman and we came to some basic terms. They are interested in having us
publish some great Traveller books -- from adventures to sourcebooks -- but we
are missing just one thing... AUTHORS!

  If you have a love of Traveller, some cool ideas for an adventure or
supplement, and a bit of talent in the writing department, then drop us a
line! We want you! You can obtain our basic Submission Guidelines from the GCS
Library on AOL or from our Home Page at
http://members.aol.com/goldrushg/index.htm.

  I'd really like to see some great Traveller material come off the GRG
presses, so all of you would-be Traveller authors out there, CONTACT US!

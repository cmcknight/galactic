
The Official Word: Publishing vs Mailing Lists

  DAVID'S ORIGINAL INQUIRY
  
   Dear Folks -
   
   Joe Walsh said:
   
   > I like space combat to be waaaay too simple to expect IG or anyone
   > else to publish something to my taste.
   
   Joe, when you come up with something, why not submit it here and to
   JTAS? There are a number of people who want a REALLY simple system -
   one actor even wanted to just use a descriptive system. This is
   something that people could use if they don't want a starship
   encounter to dominate the session, just whip out the USCS
   (Unbelievably Simple Combat System) for 5 minutes. I wouldn't imagine
   such a system being so wordy that it can't fit in a JTAS article.
   
   BTW, what are the guidelines for producing stuff here? I know that IG
   is going back to the "all rights reserved" method - when you sell them
   an article, they buy ALL the rights: first publishing, reprints, etc.
   
   However, does sending stuff to these mailing list count as
   "publishing"? No-one ever answered my query on this. My hope is that
   the lists can be used to knock the rough edges off an article (or plug
   the gaping holes) so that the final submitted work is as good as you
   can make it. Any copyright lawyers out there (Glenn, ideas)?
   
   Can IG reply to this so we have a clear indication of whether we can
   refine our ideas thru the lists?

   Dear David Jaques-Watson,
   
   > However, does sending stuff to these mailing list count as
   > "publishing"?
   
   To respond to your question, no sending 'stuff' to the mailing lists
   does not count as publishing. You may post your future JTAS article on
   say the X-boat or Traveller Digest and get feedback from all of the
   awesome TRAVELLER fans there-in, especially since until you actually
   submit the work WITH A DISCLAIMER FORM, it is not Imperium Games
   property. Note that the whole idea behind the Disclaimer form is that
   you are selling your work to Imperium Games. Imperium Games is
   purchasing your work, much the same as from a freelancer. In essence,
   you ARE a freelance author/artist if you submit your work to JTAS.
   
   > My hope is that the lists can be used to knock the rough edges off an

   Absolutely, for the purposes of feedback we highly encourage you to
   post your future article on the mailing lists. It gives you a better
   idea of how your article looks through someone elses eyes. They may
   find a mistake, or perhaps make a suggestion that would have otherwise
   gone unnoticed.
   
   IMPORTANT to note, is that while your future article is not yet
   Imperium Games property, anytime you use or refer to "Marc Miller's
   TRAVELLER", be it on paper, or computer you MUST include the Trademark
   Disclaimer:
   
   "TRAVELLER is a registered trademark of FarFuture Enterprises. All
   rights reserved."
   
   If I can be of further assistance, please let me know.

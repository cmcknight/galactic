To whom it may concern,

The following is an unfinished compilation of files which is
intended to preserve the history of GDW's & IG's policy toward the
Internet and toward the electronic fan-authored publications which
are for use with the Traveller Roleplaying Game System. Interspersed
with thess files are other files that serve as landmarks by which
the progress of the game can be gauged. Despite personal biases with
respect to the copyright issues and some gaps in the record, I have
attempted to present these files as fairly and as completely as
possible. If you take exception to any statements or would like to
add your own, please write me. Your comments may be included in the
next version of this work.

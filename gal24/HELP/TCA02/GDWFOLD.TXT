Subject: GDW shuts down
Date: 5 Jan 1996 00:20:18 GMT

GDW, publisher of the TRAVELLER, TWILIGHT: 2000, SPACE: 1889, and
DANGEROUS JOURNEYS roleplaying games, among others, is ceasing
operations. The Chicago company stops selling product January 19th
and expects to shut down completely by the end of February. GDW has
NOT filed for bankruptcy, nor will it be selling off its inventory
at a discount. According to comptroller Susan Schug, "We'll do the
best we can to take care of everybody and find homes for our games."
The miniatures games JOHNNY REB and HARPOON have both reverted to
their owners, John Hill and Larry Bond respectively. None of the
other games have been disposed of yet.
   Founding designer Frank Chadwick will now work freelance. He expects
to stay involved with his many historical games after they go to other
companies. Chadwick and Schug were the only two GDW employees left;
the company's sales had been dwindling for years.
   GDW was founded in 1973 as Game Designers' Workshop. Of the surviving
companies in the adventure gaming hobby, I believe only Avalon Hill,
Flying Buffalo, and TSR are older, but I would appreciate correction.

We're all sad to see GDW go. The company is the oldest mainline company after
AH still running, founded June 22, 1973.

The industry news about GDW going out of business after 23 years mentions the
reversion of Harpoon, Johnny Reb, and certain other titles, but their press
release is not specific about Traveller. The Traveller systems (including
Classic Traveller, MegaTraveller, and New Era)have reverted, or will revert
to myself (Marc Miller).

Rest easy, I am working hard at setting the agenda for the coming years. Wish
me luck, and send me your ideas.

Thanks,

Special note regarding jump routes
----------------------------------

There's a curious table on the second page of Book 3 (Worlds and
Adventures) of the Classic (i.e. first) Traveller Edition. This
tables goes as follows:

World              Jump Distance
Pair     Jump-1   Jump-2   Jump-3   Jump-4
A-A        1        2        4        5
A-B        1        3        4        5
A-C        1        4        6        -
A-D        1        5        -        -
A-E        2        -        -        -      Roll the cross-index
B-B        1        3        4        6      or greater on a d6
B-C        2        4        6        -      in order for a jump
B-D        3        6        -        -      route to be present
B-E        4        -        -        -
C-C        3        6        -        -
C-D        4        -        -        -
C-E        4        -        -        -
D-D        4        -        -        -
D-E        5        -        -        -
E-E        6        -        -        -

Now, just looking at it, one would think that all's well and
good, but that's not quite the case. The table was excluded from
the "Traveller Book" (a sort of v1.1 of the Classic Rules) as
well as from MegaTraveller (v2.0, or so it's considered) and the
reason may be that this table results in an awful lot of jump
routes on your subsector maps, giving them a sort of "crowded"
look. In fact, I'm convinced that GDW wasn't using this table (or
even anything approximating it) when they released the Spinward
Marches and Solomani Rim. Most likely, they drew the important
jump routes by hand.

Nonetheless, I figured it would be a good idea to include the
feature of automatically generated jump routes within the sector
generator, so the following optional table is what I finally
settled on:

World              Jump Distance
Pair     Jump-1   Jump-2   Jump-3   Jump-4
A-A        1        2        5        6
A-B        3        4        6        -
A-C        5        6        -        -
B-B        5        6        -        -
B-C        5        -        -        -

As you can surmise, this table will result in a lot fewer jump
routes than the previous one, however, you might want to go even
further by creating your own table, perhaps a very sparse one
just to include the basic routes (A-A & A-B) which you know
should be there. Hence, when generating your sector, you can opt
for the official table, the homebrew one which I created, or one
of your own creation. The best method of all, in fact, would
probably be to skip jump route generation altogether and just do
it by hand. In any case, it's entirely up to you.

The only other thing worth mentioning is that regardless of what
table you end up using, red zone (interdicted) worlds are never
attached to jump routes. Hence, if you want to have a red zone as
part of your jump route, you'll definitely need to go into the
subsector file and put it there.

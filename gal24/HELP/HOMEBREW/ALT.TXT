   Life Stat Explained
   -------------------
   0: Sterile: No indigenous life. Atmosphere is not breathable
         without substantial eco-engineering.
   1: Proto-cellular: Indigenous life consisted of amino acids
         and/or various primitive replicators. These may have
         been wiped out by transplanted organisms.
   2: Single-cellular: Transplants would have taken over.
   3: Multi-cellular: Transplants would have taken over.
   4: Complex microscopic: Lots of colorful ooze. Transplants
         would have taken over for the most part, however, there
         might be some indigenous bacteria still competing.
   5: Macroscopic: Mainly small indigenous sea-life which would
         be competing along side whatever transplants are
         present.
   6: Primitive ecosystem: Oceans are teaming with indigenous
         organisms, but land-based life is just carving out its
         niche. Transplants may have halted the advance of
         indigenous life, assuming the two are bio-compatible.
   7: Teaming ecosystem: Water/Land/Air-based herbivores and
         predators. Transplants would have a hard time competing
         in such an advanced ecosystem. Bio-compatibility would
         be an important issue.
   8: Proto-sentient: Tool-fabrication, mastery of fire.
   9: Sentient: Agriculture, language, symbology.
   A: Non-spacefaring: Planet may be a biological protectorate
         (ala the Prime Directive).
   B: Early Spacefaring: Indigenous race may have been given
         technology or may even have been genetically uplifted.
   C: Cataclysm: Result of either war, plague, or minor
          environmental mismanagement. Survivors are in a state
          of slow recovery.
   D: Green Hell: Result of major environmental mismanagement.
          World is transformed into a greenhouse.

5. Resource Level. Roll 2d6-7+Size
   confine range 0-F

   Resource Stat Explained
   -----------------------
   0: Barren
   1-4: Poor: Basic chemical diversity necessary to support
           indigenous life. Otherwise, no claim to fame.
   5-8: Moderate: Moderate resource base capable of being
           exploited for export.
   9-C: Rich: Rich resource base, one of which could command
           subsector-wide influence.
   D+ : Extreme: Very rich resource base, one of which could
           command sector-wide influence.

6. Population. Roll 2d6-2.
   if size is 2 or less, DM -1
   if atmosphere is 3 or less, DM -3
   if atmosphere is A, DM -2
   if atmosphere is B, DM -3
   if atmosphere is C, DM -4
   if atmosphere if greater than C, DM -2
   if atmosphere is 6, DM +3
   if atmosphere is 5 or 8, DM +1
   if hydro=0 and atmos>3, DM -2
   if life is 0, DM -2
   if life is 7+, DM +2
   if res is 0, DM -3
   if res is 1-4, DM -1
   if res is 5-8, DM +1
   if res is 9-C, DM +2
   if res is D+, DM +3
   confine range to 0-A

6b. Population Multiplier. Roll d9.
   if pop is 0, 5 in 6 chance that popmult = 0

7. Starport. Roll 2d6 (use whichever table suits the locality
                       but remember that high rolls result in
                       a lower quality starport).
   if pop=0, starport=X
   if pop=1, DM +2
   if pop=2, DM +1
   if pop is 6-9, DM -1
   if pop is A, DM -2
   confine range to A-X

8. Government. Roll 2d6-7+population.
   if pop=0 and popmult=0 then gov=0
   confine range to 0-F

9. Law Level. Roll 2d6-7+government.
   if gov=0 then law=0
   confine range to 0-20

10. Tech Level. Roll d6. Modify as per the standard chart
     for starport, size, hydro, and pop. Modify as per
     standard chart for atmosphere except for D-E range.
    Modify as per law as follows:
     if is law B-D, DM -1
     if is law F+, DM -2
    Modify as per government as follows:
     if gov = 1 or 5, DM +1
     if gov = 13 or 14, DM -2
     if gov = 6 or 15, DM -1
    if pop=0 & popmult=0 then tech=0
    confine lower bound of range to 0

11. Technical Depopulation.
    if hydro is 0 or A and pop is at least 6,
       then tech must at least be 4.
    if atmos is 4, 7 or 9,
       then tech must at least be 5.
    if atmos is 3 or less or A-C,
       then tech must at least be 7.
    if atmos is D or F and hydro is A,
       then tech must at least be 7.
    if tech is less than minimum requred tech then:
       pop=0, popmult=0, gov=0, law=0, tech=0, starport=X

12. Trade Classifications
    As per MegaTraveller rules except as follows:
    Deleted: Rich, Poor, and Industrial, Nonindustrial, Non-agro
    Modified: Agricultural (may include hydro 9+)
              Fluid (no size restriction, atmos A-C, hydro 1+)

13. Main Export Commodity.
    if res = 5+ & tech = 1+ & pop=5+ then try to assign an export
    (try as many times as there are resource points, choosing the
     best outcome based on tech level)
      if AG, export = d5
      otherwise, export = d29+4
    if no export is selected, then export=0

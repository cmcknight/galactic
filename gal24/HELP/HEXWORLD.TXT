Hexworld is a quick & dirty mapping program that will allow you
to draw out the major continents and oceans of your world with a
minimum of time and effort. The grid is based on the typical
icosahedral projection of twenty interlocking triangles which is
common to many game systems. Each of these is, in turn, divided
into hexagons. The program uses 490 of these hexes, and the width
of a single hex is approximately 1/35th of the world's circumference.
You can place up to forty "locations" on your world and attach text
or menu files as you deem appropriate. Note that Hexworld assumes
that all your text/menu attachments go in the same directory as your
(.hex) mapfile. Locations w/o attachments are colored blue on the
inside, and locations w/ attachments are colored red on the inside.

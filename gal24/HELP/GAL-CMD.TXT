
The Galaxy Map shows a regional map of sectors. Ones that have
been developed to some degree are shown in blue while ones that
haven't been developed (which contain only UWP data) are shown
in green. Ones that have not yet been created, if their names
are known, are shown in dark grey. Here are some commands you
can try:

 K/J/H/L/<Arrows>   Move to Neighboring Sector
     <Enter>        Select/Create Sector
      <Ins>         Create Sector
      <Del>         Delete Sector
        <           Edit Sector List
        F           Find World (search entire galaxy)
        G           Galaxy Dot-Map
        I           Import Galaxy from .sar file
        M           Sector Map
        N           Establish Sector Name
        X           Export Galaxy to .sar file
      F1/F2         View/Edit Galaxy Notes
      F3/F4         View/Edit Sector Notes
        F5          Sector Menu
        F6          Move Sector
     <Esc>, Q       Return to Menu of Galaxies

Developer Info:

The galaxy map uses the sector list for the displayed galaxy
(for example: gals\classic\classic.lst). Here's a look at a few
entries in the Classic Galaxy's list file:

Directory of Sectors
-------------------------------------------------------------
core         Core Sector                          4    1    K
beyond       The Beyond                           -1   1    L
corridor     Corridor Sector                      2    0    K
spinmar      Spinward Marches                     0    0    L
alphacru     Alpha Crucis                         5    4    I

The numbers to the right signify the positions (x,y) of the
sectors. In this file, Spinward Marches has been arbitrarily
chosen as the origin (0,0). Moving right increases "x" while
moving down increases "y". The rightmost letter indicates the
sector's color: L=Blue, K=Green, I=Grey. Sectors which are
colored grey are assumed to not exist in actual data until
they have been created. Any of these colors may be used:

 A  Black    E  Red       I  Dark Grey     M  Light Red
 B  Blue     F  Magenta   J  Light Blue    N  Light Magenta
 C  Green    G  Brown     K  Light Green   O  Light Yellow
 D  Cyan     H  White     L  Light Cyan    P  Bright White

As previously stated, I've been using light cyan (L) to
signify a sector that has been at least partially developed
(i.e. that has a few world write-ups and/or some general
information about the region). Light green (K) has been used
to signify a sector that has UWP and world names but is
otherwise undeveloped. You can change the sector colors
however you wish by editing the sector list ("<" key) of
any of the galaxies, assigning whatever meaning to the colors
you wish to use. The only exception to this rule is with dark
grey (I). The program will spot these sectors and handle them
differently from the rest, drawing on the assumption that
these sectors are entirely undeveloped and exist only in name.
In short, don't manually change the color of the dark grey (I)
sectors unless you know what you're doing. Let the program do
it for you automatically when you generate data for these
sectors.

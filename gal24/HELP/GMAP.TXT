Yo Jim,
     Brushed off my BASIC skills on the weekend. Having spent all that time
with those damn dot-plots I though thought it might be a useful feature to
have support for that in Galactic. I knew it would be slow but, what the
hell.
     It actually turned out quite a lot faster than I would have expected.
I'm caching the stuff in memory so it isn't too painful scrolling about.
Originally there were major problems because of a pathetic string space
(12K!). But I changed some of my storage to use bitfields instead of
charfields and I could expand that 8 fold. You can now get most of a screen
full of dot-plots in reasonable time.
     All the below was done with QBASIC. If anything, it should run much
better when compiled. The only problems I had were that QBASIC doesn't
understand command line stuff. Search for REM DUM and uncomment those
lines. Except for the last one which directs you to remove the hardwiring
to the solomani rim sector. Once that is done you should be able to wire it
in as a Galactic hook.
     There are bits that need work. The highlighting can probably be done
better. I'm not sure that all interpreted keys do sensible things. And the
screen saving will be saving the wrong spot. In any event, I'm sure you
will want to tweak it into compliance with the rest of your code.
     It is a hack of SECMAP.BAS. Most of my new code is in subroutines. I
even put in some basic comments. Most of the stuff in the mainline is from
there.
     Please take it on and merge it into the next release. I release all
copyrights or whatever. Your the expert on that. Change the comments
accordingly.
     More shortly...
               Jo

Jim's Notes:

Noticed some problems using the program with the TNE Galaxy.
Currently suspect that there's some mis-formatted data hidden
in one of the subsector files which is causing the program to
foul-up. Tried to debug, but I'm bumping in areas which I know
nothing about. If there are any updates to this program, either
Jo or I will post to the Galactic Mailing List about them.

Each Galaxy directory is set up as follows:

                           Galaxy Directory
                                  |
        -----------------------------------------------------
        |                  |              |                 |
       GEN             <sectors>      <galaxy>.lst       uwp.dat

    top menu is        directory       sectors         stats and the

                       sector)         in galaxy)      of each)

Each galaxy also contains a where.dat file which contains two numbers
(X,Y), telling the program of the user's last known coordinates while
visiting the galaxy.

Each sector directory is set up as follows:

                            Sector Directory
                                   |
      -------------------------------------------------------------
      |             |              |              |               |
     GEN           LOC            MAP         HEX & SYS      <sector>.dat
   General      Locations      Map files     Hexworld &      Basic Sector
 Subdirectory  Subdirectory   Subdirectory   Sysmap Dirs
 
 (General info,   (World       (Subsector     (Hexworld      (List of
 top menu is      write-ups    data files     world maps     subsectors,

                  create)      the maps       star system    & allegiance
                               are drawn)     maps           codes)

Each sector may also contain a uwp.dat file. This file acts as a
continuation of the uwp.dat contained in the galaxy directory, and in
cases of conflict, the uwp.dat at the sector level supercedes the one
at the galaxy level. Compare gals\classic\uwp.dat and gals\classic\
beyond\uwp.dat for an example of how this works.


[Q] What am I supposed to do when the files in the data\names
directory run out of names for me to use during automatic sector
generation?

[A] The original versions of these files are available in
data\names\old, so you can just copy those over. If, however,
you want to insert new names into one or more of these files,
there are several random name generation programs out there.
One of my favorites was written by Mike Harvey (mike@cs.pdx.edu),
which, when last I checked, was available at:

     ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/people/mike/names-1.0.zip

It also looks like he's upgraded this program a bit (the new
version has lots of command line parameters and wants the user to
specify an "ele" file on the command line as well). This new
version is available at:

     ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/people/mike/names201.zip

Make sure you specify the "-d" option when you unzip either of
these two programs.

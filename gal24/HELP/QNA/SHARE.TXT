
[Q] I'm working on a new galaxy, and I'd like to send it to a
friend. What should I do?

[A] Use the "X" key at the galaxy menu to export your galaxy,
putting it into a ".gar" (galaxy archive) file. Using the "X"
key at the galaxy map will export a sector to a ".sar" (sector
archive) file. Using the "I" key at either map will allow for
the importing of these files.

[Q] I'm not ambitious enough to tackle a whole galaxy, but I have
been writing some world descriptions which you might want to include
in the next version of this program. What format is best for you?

[A] Plain ol' text is best for me. Just email me your stuff, and if
it looks like you've run it through a spell-checker and got most of
the commas in the right places, I'll take care of the rest.

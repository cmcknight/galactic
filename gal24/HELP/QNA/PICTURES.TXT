
[Q] I've got some world maps drawn up in GIF format. Is there
any way to attach them to the subsector map?

[A] You need to convert them to executable format and then
attach the executable to a menu (see the world map at Spinward
Marches/1510 for an example of this). You can transfer your GIF
file to executable format by using a program called GIFEXE which
is available (in trial version) at the SimTel archive. If you
send me any GIF files you want converted (in uuencoded format), I
can also do the conversion and then send them back to you, but I
can't send you the GIFEXE program itself because it is
copyrighted by its author, Steve Enns of Saskatoon, Canada.

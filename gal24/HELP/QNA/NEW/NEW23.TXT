
[Q] What was new in version 2.3?

[A] Here are the new contributions:

  * Jens Maskus contributed the Gateway Sector (originally by DGP)
  * idiot@sans.vuw.ac.nz contributed the Dagudashaag Sector (borrowing
    world names from work by Jae Campbell, Duncan Law-Green, Leighton
    Piper and Nick Walker) as well as the Core Sector (though this one
    is still largely in need of world names)
  * Lewis Roberts contributed updates to his TNE galaxy

Here are the new program features:

  * Added automated jump route creation (F6) to subsector map
  * Added star system map creation (F9) to subsector map
  * Added dump-to-bitmap feature (F10) to various maps using
    SAVESCR v0.6 by Aaron Zabudsky <zabudsk@ecf.utoronto.ca>
  * Created data\hooks.dat file to control the calling of
    various subprograms by Gal. You can modify this file to hook
    programs that you have written into Gal, adding entirely new
    features to the software.

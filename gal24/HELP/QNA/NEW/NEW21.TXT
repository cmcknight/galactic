
[Q] What was new in version 2.1 of the program?

[A] With the 2.1 upgrade, I concentrated mainly on bug fixes
and various subtle improvements while at the same time adding
as many world descriptions as I could easily find. Here's the
main stuff:

  * Aside from red/amber zones, blue zones are now possible
  * Govt definitions separated into a user-modifiable data file
  * Population code interpretation routine fixed
  * Several sector construction menus redesigned for easier use
  * Option added for generating completely unsettled sectors
  * Configuration options incorporated directly into main menu
  * Jump route table separated into user-modifiable data file
  * Enabled the user to control the color of the jump routes
  * Developed an interactive world editor
  * Added several world write-ups from the RICE archives
  * Added Gushemege Sector from David Burden's HIWG archive
  * Added a one-sector TNE galaxy put together by Lewis Roberts
  * Added Paul Dale's "Shadows" adventure (Spinward Marches/1510)
  * Added a history for the Variant-1 Galaxy

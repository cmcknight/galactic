What's going on here w/ respect to the entries that begin with a
period (.) and the entries that have an asterisk (*) where the
starport code should be located?

[A] The period (.) is used for places where you don't want a name
showing on the map. In this case, the Idhra nebula comprises many
different hexes. We obviously want the name printed only once, so
we make sure that it isn't printed in all the other hexes by using
a period (.) for the name in those hexes. You can also do this for
worlds, but use of the "hide" (H) flag (described within the
previous help file) would be more appropriate for this purpose.
   As for the asterisk (*) entries, these are entries for various
non-world sites. They are designated by a *1, *2, *3, or *4, each
of which refer to what type of marker will be used on the subsector
map. *1 gets a triangle. *2 gets a square. *3 gets a diamond. *4
gets lots of dots (good from nebulas and such, which can encompass
multiple hexes). It's worth keeping in mind that hiding a star (*)
entry with the hide (H) flag will not only withhold the site's name
from the map, but will withhold the marker as well, so that it will
be completely invisible, unlike a star system which can usually be
seen and triangulated to a specific position even if nobody has
ever been there. This is a feature which is meant to help you hide
non-world sites from your players (secret deep-space research
stations and such). Such non-world sites can have files or menus
attached to them, but they can't have world maps attached, such as
does Thorp (2638).
   For a clearer picture of how this works, select the Variant-1
Galaxy (Gythios Sector) and go all the way to the bottom-right
corner where the Idhra Subsector is located.

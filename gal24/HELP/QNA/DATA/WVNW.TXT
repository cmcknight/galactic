
[Q] What are worlds & non-worlds?

[A] A world is just that, a world, typically the mainworld of a
star system. A non-world can be anything else, such as a deep
space research or refueling station, a derelict spacecraft which
is lost between the stars, astronomical curiosities such as
neutron stars or black holes, or even gaseous nebulas, the
stellar factories. Some examples of non-worlds are located in
the Idhra/Gythios subsector of the Variant-1 galaxy.


[Q] What are the basic differences between the data format used
for worlds versus that used for non-worlds?

[A] Quite a lot...

Here is an example world to illustrate the UWP format used by
this software:

#--------1---------2---------3---------4---------5---------6---
#PlanetName   Loc. UPP Code   B   Notes         Z  PBG Al LRX *
#----------   ---- ---------  - --------------- -  --- -- --- -
Thorp         2638 A671761-B  N                    900 Io 08N fxh
                   ||||||| |  |                 |  ||| |  ||| |||
         Starport -+|||||| |  +- Military Base  |  ||| |  ||| ||+- Hide (H,h, )
        World Size -+||||| |       Travel Zone -+  ||| |  ||| |+- Map (x,y,z, )
         Atmosphere -+|||| +- Technology Level     ||| |  ||| +- Attach (f,m, )
       Hydrographics -+|||  Population Multiplier -+|| |  ||+- Export
            Popultion -+||         Planetoid Belts -+| |  |+- Resource Level
            Government -+|               Gas Giants -+ |  +- Indigenous Life
              Law Level -+                 Allegiance -+

Notes:
   Travel Zone: <space>=green, A=amber, B=blue, R=red
   Life, Resource, Export: These are all part of the homebrew system
      and are only active when the "homebrew" method is in use.
   Attach: A file (f) or a menu (m) may be attached to the hex to
      give more detail about the world in question.
   Map: Maps may be attached as well. In such cases, an "x" in this
      position signifies that a world map is attached. "y" denotes a
      map of the star system. "z" indicates both sorts of maps.
   Hide: The world may also be hidden. "h" signifies a weak hide
      (most of the stats are hidden from the user). "H" signifies a
      strong hide (not even the world name will appear on the map,
      although the marker signifying its presence will still be drawn).


Here's another example, only this one is for a non-world:

#--------1---------2---------3---------4---------5---------6---
#PlanetName   Loc. UPP Code   B   Notes         Z  PBG Al LRX *
#----------   ---- ---------  - --------------- -  --- -- --- -
Derelict      2836 *3 Abandoned Vessel          R      Io     f H
                   ||                           |      |      | |
         Asterisk -++- Marker (1,2,3,4)         |      |      | +- Hide (H,h, )
  (signifies this                  Travel Zone -+      |      +- Attach (f,m, )
  as a non-world)                          Allegiance -+

Notes:
   Marker: 1=triangle, 2=square, 3=diamond, 4=lots-o-dots
   Attach: f=file, m=menu
   Map: Generally speaking, non-worlds don't have maps
   Hide: H=strong, h=soft (strong hide will hide both the name
      as well as the marker, while a soft hide will hide only
      the explanation... in this case "Abandoned Vessel")

Non-worlds can be edited just like worlds, even by the use of
UWPedit which is accessable via the F3 key from the subsector map.


In order for the program to know what galaxies are available and
what sectors are available within those galaxies, it uses a series
of list (.lst) files. The primary file is gals\gal.lst:

Directory of Galaxies
--------------------------------------------------------
classic      Semi-Official Traveller Galaxy
tne          New Era Galaxy
var1         Variant 1
gmc          Greater Magellanic Cloud

If you want to get rid of one of these galaxies, so that the
program no longer knows it exists, you have the delete its line
from this file (Galactic can also do this automatically from
the galaxy menu).

Every galaxy directory (classic, tne, var1, gmc) contains a list
file, which is a directory of the sectors contained by the galaxy.
The list file for the Classic galaxy is gals\classic\classic.lst:

reaversd     Reaver's Deep                        2    3    I

Here, the story is much the same, except we have three extra stats.
The two numbers (X,Y) determine the location of the sector. The
idea here is that X gets bigger as you go to the right (east). Y
gets bigger as you go down (south). Negative numbers are
perfectly acceptable.

The letter at the end (Color) determines the color used to
display the sector:

    A  Black    E  Red       I  Dark Grey     M  Light Red
    B  Blue     F  Magenta   J  Light Blue    N  Light Magenta
    C  Green    G  Brown     K  Light Green   O  Light Yellow
    D  Cyan     H  White     L  Light Cyan    P  Bright White

I've been using "L" (light cyan) for sector that are developed
(which have world write-ups, etc). "K" (light green) has been
used for sectors that have been generated but not developed (the
sector data exists, but there are no world write-ups). "I" (dark
grey) has been used for sectors that do not exist except in name
(no data has been generated for them).

You can use any of the colors to represent your sectors, and they
can mean whatever you want them to mean, however, "I" (dark grey)
is a reserved color in the sense that Galactic will assume that
all dark grey sectors do not exist except in name.

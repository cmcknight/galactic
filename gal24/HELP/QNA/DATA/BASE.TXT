
[Q] In the gals\classic\spinmar\spinmar.dat file, the basic sector
data file for the Spinward Marches sector of the Classic Traveller
galaxy, you have the following:

                    Bases:
                    N = Navy
                    S = Scout
                    A = Navy & Scout
                    B = Navy & Marine
                    Z = Navy & Marine
                    D = Navy & Marine
                    M = Planetary Guard
                    W = Way Station
                      = None

What does this mean?

[A] This table simply defines the bases codes used by worlds within
the subsector. Going to the gals\classic\spinmar\map\rhylanor.dat
file, we see a whole subsector of worlds. Rhylanor, the capital,
looks like this:

  #PlanetName   Loc. UPP Code   B   Notes         Z  PBG Al LRX *
  #----------   ---- ---------  - --------------- -  --- -- --- -
  Rhylanor      2716 A434934-F  A Hi Cp              810 Im     m
                                ^

As you can see, the Base Code is "A", meaning that Rhylanor has
both a Naval and a Scout base.

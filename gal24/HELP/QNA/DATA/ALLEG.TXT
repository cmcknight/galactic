
[Q] In the gals\classic\spinmar\spinmar.dat file, the basic sector
data file for the Spinward Marches sector of the Classic Traveller
galaxy, you have the following:

                   Allegiance:
                   12 Im = Imperial
                   14 As = Aslan
                   11 Zh = Zhodani
                   13 Va = Vargr
                   03 Sw = Sword Worlds
                   01 Da = Darrian
                   10 Dr = Droyne
                   07 Na = Non-aligned
                   04 Cs = Client State
                   05 Fa = Federation of Arden
                   08    = Unknown

I understand that these are allegiance codes, but what are the
numbers on the left?

[A] The numbers each represent different colors, which is
important because planets are colored according to their national
allegiance. The numbers can be translated as follows:

 00  Black    04  Red       08  Dark Grey     12  Light Red
 01  Blue     05  Magenta   09  Light Blue    13  Light Magenta
 02  Green    06  Brown     10  Light Green   14  Light Yellow
 03  Cyan     07  White     11  Light Cyan    15  Bright White

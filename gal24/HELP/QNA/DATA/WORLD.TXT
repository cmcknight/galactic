following stuff:

What's this mean?

[A] This file you're looking at is a subsector file. It contains
world data, one world per line. The "Loc" entries represent the
hex/parsec locations of these worlds, their coordinates within the
sector. The UPP code contains starport, size, atmosphere type,
hydrographics, population, government type, law level, and the
technological level of the world (which are all defined in the
gals\classic\uwp.dat file). Then comes the base entry (it looks
like Penelasse has a scout base). Then there are the trade codes
represented by two-symbol combinations within the notes section.
Then there's the Travel Zone (blank means it's green, i.e. nothing
special, but A=Amber and R=Red, indicating places you'd probably
rather avoid). The PBG section shows the population multiplier, the
number asteroid belts, and the number of gas giants. Next is the
allegiance section (all these worlds are "Im" for Imperial
allegiance). Then there's the LRX section, which is usually only
used with the homebrew/variant world generation system presented as
an alternative to the official system. Here we would see the life,
resource, and export codes of the world in question, although in
this subsector file, they aren't being used. See the Variant-1
galaxy for a situation where they are.
   Finally there's the "*" field beginning in the 63rd column
which serves several special purposes. It can contain up to three
characters. The first column in used for file/menu attachment.
The second column is used for map attachment. The third column is
used for the "hide" flag

File/Menu attachment: An "f" here means that there's a description
file written in plain language about this world. These files are
contained (in this instance) in the gals\classic\gush\loc directory.
The text file for Mulanje is gals\classic\gush\loc\p2306.txt. An "m",
however, means that there are several description files which are
accessible from a menu file. The menu file for Choma is
gals\classic\gush\loc\p2308.mnu.

Map attachment: An "x" here means that there's a world map located
in the "hex" directory of the sector in question. Galactic makes
use of hexworld.exe to draw these maps. See the example map at
Thorp/Idhra/Gythios of the Variant-1 Galaxy. A "y" means that
a map of the star system is present. "z" means that both sort of
maps are available.

"Hide" flag: An "h" or an "H" may be placed in this field. This
signifies that the stats for this world are to be hidden from the
casual user, probably meaning that nobody has yet explored the
world and so that any information about it is privledged for the
GM's eyes alone. Big "H" is considered to be a stronger "hide" then
small "h", so that with big "H" in effect, not even the world's
name will be displayed.
   If you use Galactic in your campaign, you might want to mark a
whole slew of worlds with the "h" or the "H", so that your players
can't see what's there. Then, when they get to the world and begin
learning more about it, you can remove the "hide" flag and perhaps
even have them write a report describing what they found (this is
ideal for exploration-based campaigns where the characters are on
a scouting mission).

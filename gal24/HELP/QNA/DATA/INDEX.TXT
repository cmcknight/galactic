file for the Gushemege sector of the Classic Traveller galaxy, you
have the following:

A: Riften                    sec_a.dat
B: Khiira                    sec_b.dat
C: Taapvaia                  sec_c.dat           f
D: Tansa                     sec_d.dat           f
E: Gandonen                  sec_e.dat
F: Rure                      sec_f.dat           f
G: Ankhsusgar                sec_g.dat
H: Isi Ahto                  sec_h.dat
I: Balech                    sec_i.dat           f
J: Sallounn                  sec_j.dat           f
K: Dashinshaii               sec_k.dat
L: Shire                     sec_l.dat
M: Vipach                    sec_m.dat           f
N: Laeth                     sec_n.dat           f
O: Truax                     sec_o.dat
P: Lagan                     sec_p.dat

What's all this mean?

[A] There are sixteen subsectors in every sector, and these are
given letters of designation (A-P). The sixteen lines shown above
are a sort of index of the subsector data files contained in the
gals\classic\gush\map directory. The f's on the right indicate
subsectors where a description file is available, that is a file
written in plain english describing the subsector as a whole. Such
files are contained in the gals\classic\gush\loc directory, and are
named sub-?.txt where ? is the letter of the subsector in question.
   If you have a lot of stuff to write about a given subsector, you
might want to use a menu file instead, to help separate the stuff
out, in which case you would use an "m" on the right in place of
one of the f's. In such an instance, your menu file would still be
located in the gals\classic\gush\loc directory and would be named
sub-?.mnu where ? is the letter of the subsector in question.
   Take a peak at some of the .txt and .mnu files in gals\classic\
gush\loc for examples of the differences between text and menu
files and how menu files are organized. See also the help file on
menu files.

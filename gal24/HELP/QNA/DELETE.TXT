
[Q] How do I delete a galaxy from the galaxy menu or a sector
from the sector menu?

[A] Hit the <delete> key at either the galaxy menu or the galaxy
map. If you want to know the internals of what's going on when
you do this, take a look at gals\gal.lst which is a file in the
main Galactic directory. This file contains a list of the galaxies
that the program knows about. By removing one of the lines from
this file, you effectively remove the program's knowledge that a
specific galaxy exists.
   Likewise, you will notice that in each of the galaxy
directories, there is another .LST file, and that it contains a
list of the sectors in that galaxy. To remove knowledge of a
specific a sector, remove the line pertaining to that sector.
   In each case, you might also want to delete the directory tree
pertaining to that galaxy or sector, just to save some hard drive
space and so that you can create a new one using the same name if
you so desire. Galactic will do this for you automatically when
you use the <delete> key, but now that you know the process, you
can also do it manually from the dos-prompt.

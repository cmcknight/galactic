
[Q] Is there any way to print the sector or subsector maps or
convert them into some standard image format?

[A] There's no print feature, per se, but you can take screen
captures of various maps using the F10 key. This will dump the
map into bitmap format in the main galactic directory. If you
prefer gif format, I've had some success using a program
written by Henrique Vianna (snoopy@ufpel.tche.br) called "Capture
It!" which is a screen-capturing utility that runs in the
background under DOS as a terminate-and-stay-resident program.
"Capture It!" is available at the SimTel archive:

 ftp://ftp.uoknor.edu/pub/simtelnet/msdos/screen/capture22.zip

Included in the package is a program that converts the screen
captures to GIF format. From there, you can probably load your
GIFs into some paint-program and do your printing that way.

Another method is to use the grab.com and graphcnv.exe utilities
which are part of the WordPerfect 5.1 package (they probably exist
in some other versions as well). If you have WP51, type "grab /h"
and "graphcnv /h" for more information.

Yet another method, which nearly everyone has at their disposal, is
to access Galactic via a DOS-Window from Windows, then to take a
screen capture via the Alt-PrintScreen function, and then to
Edit/Paste the map into some piece of Windows software ("Write" for
example, which is under the "Accessories" program group). You can
alternatively paste screen-captures to Paint Shop Pro, inverting
the picture and converting it to grayscale to get a black on white
background. For better resolution, resample to 600x881.

Also, Hugh Foster <100326.446@CompuServe.COM> has written a Windows-
based program called Hexmap which displays and prints subsectors from
text data files. He recently wrote a version which copes with sectors
in Galactic v2.1 format. The differences between v2.1 and this version
are pretty minimal, so the program ought to work. If not, bug him :-)

If you come up with another method which you think is pretty
straight-forward and fairly accessible for most people, please let
me know about it.

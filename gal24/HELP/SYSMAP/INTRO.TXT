Sysmap is a quick & dirty star system mapper. The general idea is
that you're given a random star system which has no bearing to the
mainworld stats used in Galactic. Your job is to edit the star
system to your liking.

Here's a brief summary of the available commands:

      Arrows          Movement
     PgUp/PgDn        Go to top/bottom
      Q/Esc           Quit (saving changes)
       ?/H            View this file
       1/2            Move planet along orbit
       3/4            Move orbit left/right (eccentricity)
       5/6            Make orbit thinner/fatter (eccentricity)
        A             Add new planet
        C             Change color of planet or star
        D             Change planet's/star's description
        M             Change planet's # of moons
        N             Change planet's/star's name
        O             Change color of planet's orbit
        P             Change planet type (includes planet removal)
        S             Change star type
        #             Change planet's orbit
       Ins            Attach file, menu, or world map
       Del            Detach file, menu, or world map
   Enter/Space        View attachment
        >             Edit attachment
        <             Save & edit star system file directly
      Ctrl-L          Redraw map
      Ctrl-X          Exit (without saving changes)
        F1            Generate new star system (keeping hub stars)
        F2            Generate new star system (ditching hub stars)
       F10            Dump display to bitmap

Note that inner orbits are red, biozone orbits are green, outer
orbits are blue, asteroid belt orbits are grey, and eccentric
orbits are magenta. If an orbit comes up that's colored yellow
(which may happen if you use the "S" function), that means the
orbit is inside the primary's vaporization limit (where rock
literally boils away). In any case, any world residing in such
an orbit would be rather unlikely.

Note also that many star systems are actually "double" systems (two
star systems in relatively close proximity). If a far companion is
present, that means the star system you're looking at is a doubleu
system. Hit <enter> at the "Far Companion" to see the other half of
the system.

Good luck, and please send suggestions, bug reports, and questions
to jimv@empirenet.com or to the Galactic Mailing List.

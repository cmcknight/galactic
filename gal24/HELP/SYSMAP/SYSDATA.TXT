
Star System Data Format
-----------------------

Here's an example star system (the "Haven" system). As you can see,
it is a double system. The main system comprises the first half of
the data file. The far companion's system comprises the 2nd half.

# refers to the orbit number of the body in question. If #=0 then
we're dealing with an object at the system's hub, most probably a
star. The hub of Haven's main system is a double star, a pair of
reds of the main sequence variety (MV). The far companion, on the
other hand, is a single star, an orange (KV).

OSC refers to orbit color, object (planet or star) size, and object
(planet or star) color. The color codes are as follows:

    A  Black    E  Red       I  Dark Grey     M  Light Red
    B  Blue     F  Magenta   J  Light Blue    N  Light Magenta
    C  Green    G  Brown     K  Light Green   O  Light Yellow
    D  Cyan     H  White     L  Light Cyan    P  Bright White

ExEy refers to the eccentricity of the orbit. 5010 is considered to
be a standard (non-eccentric) orbit. Anything else is eccentric. Ex
refers to right/left deviation. Ey refers to a deviation in shape.

Deg refers to the position along its orbit at which a planet can be
found. This is expressed in degrees (0-259).

M refers to the number of moons (A=10, B=11, etc...).

Each object (star or world) has a name, a comments area for a brief
description, and an attachment area where a file, menu, or hexworld
can be attached. As you will note, the asteroid belt in Haven's
main system has an attached file named "haven.txt". You can include
the path to the file if the file doesn't reside in the same
directory as the star system (.sys) file.

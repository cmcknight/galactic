Please send your contributions either to the list address or to me
directly. For binary files (such as zip files, or gifs if you want to
send me some art), I can handle MIME-encoding but prefer uuencoding
if you can do that. Either way though, I should be able to process
it just fine. I'd prefer it if you made your text submissions in
plain ol' text format since this is the format the program assumes
(it is also best if you keep the line lengths below 80 columns and
use spaces rather than tabs for paragraph indentation and centering).
One additional note about the formatting. The dos version of "less",
which does most of the text reading for Galactic, ignores the
tilde-character (~) for some reason. Hence, it's best to avoid using
this character if at all possible. I may decide to switch to a
program called "browse" if this becomes a problem. Finally, please
include your name & email address in the actual files you send me so
that there's no chance of me screwing up and failing to properly
credit the submission.

Many thanks...  jimv@empirenet.com

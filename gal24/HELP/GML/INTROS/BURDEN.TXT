Subject: Hi all

Hi,

Just a quick first message. My name is David Burden (
david@innocom.demon.co.uk or david.burden@sts.co.uk ). I've been the
HIWG Gushemege analyst for almost ever and was responsible ( with my
co-developer Leighton Piper ) for naming all the worlds in Gushemege
and updating the sector files. I did my own sector viewer for the
Atari, but with Galactic there's no need to convert it to the PC. I am
kept pretty busy by Traveller writing commitments ( I co-authored The
Long Way Home - the only M0 adventure, and set in Gushemege, and am
writing new stuff for 1997  ), and so my main interest is in
supporting Gushemege sector data. For TLWH I did a spreadsheet to
"wind back" 1116 data to M), which I'll happily circulate if this
interests people. 

That's all for now, I look forward to participating in the list.

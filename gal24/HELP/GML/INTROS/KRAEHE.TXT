	Well I'm called Kraehe (german word for Crow) as my "totem" name.
	I'm refereeing a TNE campain, in Rure and around for 4 years, and
	even if its not 100% canon (I dont have Arival V), I've undertook
	the major work of collecting my notes to provide a set of writeups
	for the Rurevayn. I allways call it " my little core ", and tried
	to " seek to preserve the knowledge and wisdom of the past " just
	to cite the Olputouen religion.

	If this posting manage to reflect on the list, I'll send my texts.
	They are fairly large (currenly 750 lines, 42KB), so I think I'll
	send them one text per day to fill the next month, to give you
	the oportunity to read them carefully, not only for checking canon
	but also to improve my grammar and spelling, as I'm a german guy
	and neither a native american nor english aborigine ;-)

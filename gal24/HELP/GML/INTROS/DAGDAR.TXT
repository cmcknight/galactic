Subject: Hello List

Hiya everyone. As requested by the welcome message, the following is some
quick data about me:

1. My name is Bob Kondrk (it looks like it's missing a letter but it's not.)

2. My main e-mail address is dss2@erols.com, but I also use OGFDagdar@aol.com.
I would have used my Erol's acct to subscribe to the list, but my wife already
complains about the "clutter" we get from the TML. :) She's been starting to
get the Traveller bug lately too though...

3. What I'd like to do is to add an additional system generation tool to
Galactic that allows genning Book 6 systems. My C++ is still not up to par for
the task yet, but I'm getting there.

4. I come from Rahway, New Jersey, and I'm developing a set of sectors in the
vacinity of the Orion Nebula that precariously conforms to canon. It's about
420 parsecs rimward of the Solomani Rim, and was settled by a Terran
Confederation research team that decided to stay on.

Thanks for allowing me to subscribe to this list, and thanks for Galactic. Now
that I use it I don't know how I did without it all these years!

Thanks,

Bob Kondrk

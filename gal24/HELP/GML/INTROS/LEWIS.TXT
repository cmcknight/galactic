Hi Folks,

My name is Lewis Roberts. I am running a TNE campaign set in the
Reformation Coalition, so my main intrest right now is on the area
surrounding the Old Expanses.  I have written several worlds up in the
Old Expanses, and these were included in the last version of Galactic.

Since then I have typed in the 1200 stats for Diaspora sector, I was told
by Jim that someone else was typing in the 1120 stats.  As my campaign
slowly explores different worlds I am writting them up and inserting them
into Galactic.

I have the program on my laptop, and bring it along with me to my games.
I have one universe setup for my players, with the 1120 data, and as
they slowly explore, they get the new data.  I have another universe setup
for me, which has the 1200 stats.  My players make copious  notes about
what they did at each planet.  They are all very impressed with the program
and seem to like it alot.

Personal Stuff: I am an astronomy graduate student at Georgia STate
Univ in Atlanta.  I have about 1.5 yrs to go, and then I'll enter the
real world. :)  My thesis is on imaging with interferometers, if that
means anything to you. :)  I have been  playing Traveller since Jan 1982.
I prefer the TNE rules, because I like complicated rule systems. :)

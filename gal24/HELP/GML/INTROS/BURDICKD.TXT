Subject: Intro.

Hi, my name is Dakin Burdick -- the manager of this list.  I've played
rpgs since 1976 and Traveller since it came out.  I still play and
run Classic Traveller (with a touch of Megatraveller).  Jim's "Galactic"
program got me all fired up about Traveller again, and since my current
gang of players had NEVER played a space game, I thought I'd give it a
whirl.  I've written up Magyar sector for inclusion in the next version
of Galactic (I am still working on those additions Jim, and I WILL get
them to you soon!).  On the personal side, I am a 4th dan in T'aegwondo
and 1st dan in Hapkido (those are martial arts for those of you who 
don't know) while my wife is 2nd and 1st respectively (my 8 month old
son is not yet ranked :)  ).  I will be defending my dissertation in
American History and American Studies this May (hopefully!), with my
topic being:  "Dirty Fighting":  Boxing and Judo in America, 1845-1945.

One thing I could really use is a copy of the Dark Nebula and Diaspora
sectors from whomever is working on them, so we can figure out what the
jump routes should be from each of these.  When I wrote up Magyar, I 
discovered that two of the jump routes from the Solomani Rim didn't make
sense, so they had to be changed.  Whoever is doing the Dark Nebula 
sent me a copy, but I haven't been able to uudecode it.

Thanks!

PS:  You might also be interested to know that the "Starform" program 
that is out as freeware was designed by my brother Matt, who was an
astrophysics/computer science double major.  I think Traveller affected
his early development pretty hard! :)

Subject: Hello Fellow Galacticans.

Hi everybody.  I'm glad to see so many people interested in Jim's program,
it's been a big help to me.  Well, I'm new to this list, and I'm told it's
good netiquette to introduce one's self:

Charles Collin, Scientist, 2 terms.
864AD7.  Gaming-3, Psychology-2, Vision Science-2, Computer-2,
Boomerang-1, Curling-1, Video games-1. 

I'm from Montreal (originally born in the arctic regions of Quebec) and
I've been playing Traveller for over a decade now.  The original Traveller
was a godsend when I started getting tired of D&D, but I have to admit
that after three screwed up versions (IMHO) I'm switching to my own
system.  My most recent campaign started a couple of months ago, but has
gone on hiatus for the holidays.  I'm going to start it up again soon with
my own homegrown rules.

Oh, but don't worry, I'm still using the good ol' Traveller system
generator and the Traveller history and background, so I'll have plenty to
contribute to this list.  My main contribution to Galactic has been a set
of data files containing randomly-generated alien world names and a couple
of small programs to scramble them up (this last was necessary because to
the way Galactic sequentially takes names from the files). If memory
serves, there are now files for Zhodani, Aslan, Vargr (two varieties),
Darrian, Droyne, and K'Kree.  If anyone wants to make files for other
races, I can tell them how. 

Well that's itfrom me for now...

Happy Travelling!
Charles.

Can anything truly meaningful be said in just a single line?  Maybe, maybe
not.    -Charles Collin. (charles@hebb.psych.mcgill.ca)

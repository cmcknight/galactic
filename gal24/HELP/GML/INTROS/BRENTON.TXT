What I want;
Some more detail on worlds; especially in and around the Spinward Marches
in 1107-1120 (no rebellion, no virus).

What I have;
A detailed, but not official picture of Glisten, in 1117.  This includes
corporations, actively mined belts, "The Hab" (one city, 6 billion
people).  Slang terms, cultural info, etc.  

I do not (yet) have Galactic, but am willing to do some work in it.

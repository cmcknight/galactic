1.  Name: Scott Galliand

2.  Email address: galliand@juno.com

3.  The area(s) of Galactic which you are interested in developing:
I am currently working on the Neworld sector for the HIWG.  Right now I'm
working on the time around the Classic/MT era.  I'd be interested in
working on that sector, as well as Hadji sector (the one rimward of it).

4.  As much background information about yourself as you care to share
Programmer, RPGer since 1980 (Traveller player since 1982, but have
significant gaps due to lack of players/GMs (Louisiana isn't exactly a
mecca for Traveller players.  Still very much under the thumb of AD&D)). 
Currently developing a PBEM for T4 (Leaning on starting it in the Old
Earth Union).

Hi, I'm Rob Beck and I'm a Traveller addict.

<<Hi Rob>>

Now that that's out of the way, I've been looking into redeveloping the
Glimmerdrift Reaches from the ground up. I've not gotten a chance to look at
the old Judges Guild material, but have never heard very good reviews on it.
So, I thought it might be best to try to redesign it and put a little
thought into it instead of building on something not many people liked
anyway. I like the area because it's a border zone and has so much
potential. Client states, Imperial territory, just like the Hinterworlds,
this area has a lot to offer. The area between the Imperium and K'kree
territory just begs to be fleshed out better. What is everyone else working on?

What's there to say about me? I've played and run Traveller at different
times over the past twelve years. Currently, I'm residing in Indianapolis,
IN trying to juggle a state job and working as a subcontractor. Typical
twenty-something (don't you hate that phrase?) gamer realizing he has less
time than he did before going into the working world to game and have fun. 

Looking forward to working with you all.

Rob.

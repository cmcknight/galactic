Hi,
     Just joined the list , been using GAL21 for several months. My bio is
below. Other info after that.

        I've entered the UWPs I created for Ustral Quadrent using MTA2's dot
maps & AM5: Solomani for locations of early Terran settlements (also entered
DGP's Dark Nebula data to look at Jump Routes common to both sectors.)  I
find GAL helpful in figuring out the steller cartography for a sector ( i.e.
if you need J-2 or J-3 to get around.) I'm working on ideas for the three
Aslan Client States as to why they weren't absorbed by the Hierate. Thats it
for now.

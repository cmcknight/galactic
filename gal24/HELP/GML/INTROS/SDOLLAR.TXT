Hello all!

I have been currently working on/or have finished a number of sectors 
for this program as follows:

Diaspora:  
CT Complete
MT Hard Times Era (Astrogators Guide to Diaspora Sector)  Completed
TNE (TNE Boxed Set) 80% complete

Dark Nebula:  MT  (Solomani & Aslan) Complete

Massilia:  MT (Knightfall) Complete

Reavers' Deep:  Map Complete.  Currently developing Reavers' Deep 
world descriptions for Various worlds within sector for an ongoing 
IRC campaign.  Many names on Reavers' Deep are original, btw, as 
sector was never fully developed by GDW or DGP.

Spinward Marches: 
TNE (Regency Sourcebook)  Complete
Other sectors from RSB incomplete

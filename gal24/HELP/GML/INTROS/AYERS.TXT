1.  Your name: Mark Ayers

2.  Your email address: mark@bbic.com

3.  The area(s) of Galactic which you are interested in developing: As a
referee that is never content to use a background universe I am not
completely familiar with in all its basic assumptions a nuances, I look
forward to using Galactic to speed the development of a new
Traveller(TM) universe. As a longtime programmer of little utilities for
the RPG system I love I also look forward to examining the work of
others. As always, the work of the hard-core fan community makes the
difference.

4.  As much background information about yourself as you care to share:
I have been gaming Traveller since '78. Currently a few friends get
together each Wednesday night at Metro Seattle Gamers in Seattle's
Ballard neighborhood for Traveller where we share the development of
stories and adventures to rival the heroic works of Homer himself.

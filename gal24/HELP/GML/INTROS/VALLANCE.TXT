1.  Your name
    Andrew Juncker Moffatt-Vallance, but since that is just a bit of a handful
    I usually just go by Andrew Vallance

2.  Your email address
    Well at the moment its: a.vallance@netaccess.co.nz, but it going
    to change within a month or so

3.  The area(s) of Galactic which you are interested in developing
    I'm currently developing an area in the Greater Magellanic Cloud.

4.  As much background information about yourself as you care to share
    I started playing traveller way way back in 78 (leans back on his walking
    stick "In my day........") and continued up till TNE was released. Then
    marriage and family intervened (as it did with many of the people I
    played with). But now the kiddies are growd up a bit, I have more time
    on my hands and have started RPG's again (the other game I play is
    Runequest incidentally). I've never played in the 'official' universe;
    closest I got was a setting some sectors distant from the developed areas
    (basically bowing to preasure from my players to let them have Solomani
    and Vargr). I make my living as a graphic artist and IT manager. I have: a
    degree in sociology, two kids, a wife, a dog, two cats, an exhorbitant
    mortgage.

  Andrew etc.

Hiya!

My name is John Watts.  I'm 26 yrs old and I live in North Georgia.  I've been 
playing Traveller now for 12 years and have been running several campaigns
(in the same background) throughout that period.  I have been working on the
Magyar sector for most of that 12 years and have a LOT of material for that
area.  I've also been exploring a lot of ideas in other portions of the
Solomani Sphere.

     You can contact me at the following:

Subject: Introduction

Hello everyone.  Here is my "first message brief biography":

Bill Skerbitz
skerbiwj@caa.mrs.umn.edu

I am interested in developing any area which needs to be developed.

I was first exposed to traveller in 1987 (CT), and fell in love with the
game.  However, the people I played with all moved away within the next
three or four years, and I was stuck without a gaming group (I'm from a
small town in northern Minnesota, so interest in the idea of
Science-Fiction RPG's was small)...

...just this summer (I've been out of it for a while) I found out that a
new "retrograded" edition of Traveller came out (T4) so I went and
bought the rulebooks and whatever other material I could find for the
new system, and again rediscovered my love for the game.  Now I am
starting a campaign-gaming group here at the University of Minnesota,
Morris, and am interested in developing sectors (a couple of which I
already did out of boredom when all my friends left in the early
90s...all I have to do is find them).

I'll be looking forward to working with you on this endeavor.

Sincerely,
Bill Skerbitz
U of MN Morris

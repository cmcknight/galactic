Howdy all.

Some of you have already spoke to me so you have a bit of an idea as to 
who I am others are probably looking at my name and wondering who the 
heck that guy is.

First off, my name is Derek Stanley and yes that .ca after my address 
does imply that a call the "Great White North" my home.  Those of you who 
are Canadian will obviously get that reference.

As of late I've become rather distant from Traveller thing's for one 
reason or another.  However, not being one to over look a potentially 
great project I'm exceptionally interested in Jim's Galactic project.

My personal area's of interest are Daibei and Reaver's Deep, specifically 
the boarder area between the two.  I've based a TNE campaign quite 
heavilly in that region and have done extensive work on making that place 
home.

Personally I'm more interested in the history and how it all fits 
together in the area and I've done a fair amount of work on that.  

My own background is based rather heavilly in history, I've got a degree 
in archaeology and I did a bit of work in anthropology and geography.  I 
work with car's now, go figure???  But I do enjoy writing and I consider 
myself to be an idea's person, once I've started I can go on for weeks 
creating and such, I just need a spark.

Well that's pretty much it for me.  I've got a number of collapsed 
sectors and pre-collapse data involving six sub-sectors along the boarder 
I'd be more than happy to contribute.

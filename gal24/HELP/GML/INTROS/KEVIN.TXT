As requested from the welcome message, here is just some information about
me:

1.  My name is Kevin Williams and have been playing Traveller for a number
of years but have slacked off in the past few couple of years.  My main
email is warlocke@fm-net.com or 3k@angelfire.com.  My webpage is also
http://www.angelfire.com/nd/3k/index.html.

2.  I am in the process of creating a program like Jim Vassilakos' package
of programs.  It many take awhile and since I talked to him...he said I am
not the first to try and complete one.  But if all goes good, I WILL
COMPLETE IT!

Thanks

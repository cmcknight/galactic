Hi! As a new subscriber, just saying my helloes. I hope we can all increase
each others' collection of mapped, detailed, wonderful sectors to run games in.

My first act will be to humbly draw attention to my own Hexmap program,
available from the below URL. Illustrating splendidly the theory of parallel
evolution, it is a Windows-based proggie which displays and prints subsectors
from ASCII data files.

I have tonight uploaded a new version, which copes with DAT files as found
in Galactician. If you (like me) run Gal from Windows, this plugs the gap
of printing the maps.

If it craps out on you - unlikely but possible - please let me know. If you
like it, also let me know!

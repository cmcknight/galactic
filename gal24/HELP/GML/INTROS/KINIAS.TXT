Greetings GMLers!

I understand that Glimmerdrift Reaches is already taken, and although
for my own purposes I'll stick to the one I've generated (using only the
old CT Library Data maps), I'm interested in neighboring sectors, both
CT and TNE (and M:0, for that matter!).

My concentration has been on the Novomirskaja Imperija, a small TNE
pocket empire at the edge of the Delphi-GR rift, but I'm also interested
in working on Fornast, Ley Sector, Delphi, Hinterworlds, Crucis Margin,
and anything else nearby, for any milieu.

> 4.  As much background information about yourself as you care to share

I am a Greek-American physics/astronomy undergraduate on extended
holiday in Egypt, where I work as an "English as a foreign language"
teacher.  I also work as an IS specialist and technical writer for an
institutional-development consulting firm.

My main non-scientific interests of relevance to Traveller are history
(especially military and international-affairs) and comparative politics
and sociology.

My pet project for the last couple of years has been the development of
my Novomirskaja Imperija, a Glimmerdrift Reaches pocket empire.

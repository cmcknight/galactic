I am a computer programmer at Fidelity Investments in Covington, KY. I've
been there just over a year. On the side (and virtually guaranteeing any
time I get off is a busman's holiday), I'm programming software for the
Internet (e-mail, newsreader, ftp), just to see if I can do it.

I've been on Usenet and addicted to mailing lists for far too long to
admit; right now, I subscribe to about 12 mailing lists. (Thank goodness my
ISP gives me a 25MB mail quota ;-))

I've been gaming since playing someone's warped idea of how the rest of the
sample adventure from blue-book D&D should go (the one with the skeleton in
the middle of the stream). I've become disenchanted with T4 -- which I
bought  and wanted remembering some excellent Traveller games played in jr.
high -- because of the quality of the main rulebook and the only supplement
I bought (one chance out of three -- picked Starships... ah, well) and will
be waiting for M:0 to make my final decision on whether or not the game is
worth supporting.

I also enjoy GURPS, Everway, Dragonlance: 5th Age, Feng Shui, The End, and
far too many other games to mention.

It's great to see interest in the wonderful TRAVELLER universe, especially
the creation thereof.

Intro:

Name:  David Murray

GAL interest:  I am mainly a starship architect at heart.  But I'm also
interested in a COMPLETE map/infobase of known Traveller space.  I think
this GML (GALACTIC Mailing List) is the best effort to complete such a
project.  My best input will be of the common sense type, but I am also
looking for a small section of space to place a world that I created in the
MT days.  Its a TL18, yes eighteen, world I rolled straight up for a new
character.  I've been obsessed with it ever since.  The problem I have in
placing it is that it must be more than six hex from the nearest system. 
Long story behind the mandate.

My background:  I am an electronic technician by trade.  I live in Omaha,
NE, USA.  Hobbies include computers, science/technology, SF
Television/Film, and Traveller.  I have been playing Traveller since 1983. 
I am currently on a quest to gather ALL information available, printed and
electronic.  I have a way to go, but I think it will be worthwhile when I
get everything up to date.  If anyone has a section of space I would be
glad to do some more work on my world/system to be able to enter it into
GAL.

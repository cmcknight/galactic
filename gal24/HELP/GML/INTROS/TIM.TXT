Subject: Intro

Let me introduce myself I am...

My name is Tim Reynolds and I just turned 27 on the 12th, happy birthday
to me and HAL and Andy Brick.
 I have been playing RPG since I was nine when yet another evil older
 brother introduced me to D&D and  Traveller shortly after our parents
 got on a religious kick about D&D.  I stopped playing Traveller in
 about 85 when I couldn't find anybody to game with as they had all
 moved to another base.  Since then I have played lots of different
 RPG including AD&D, Twilight 2000, Cyber Punk, FWRG(best Fantasy in
 my book) and lately WW game.  I always wanted to get back into
 Traveller but never liked, the new stuff enough to buy any.   Then I
 heard Marc was writing new rules and I picked them up.  I must say I
 found the effort worth it.  I followed the IG website connection
 found the mailing list and the IRC line made new friends and became
 amazed at the love people have for their game.  I believe that
 anybody who wants to should be allowed to roleplay and have actively
 recruit young people as well as females.

As you can  see I have decide to kill two birds with one introduction.
 As for my activity with this mailing list I would like to support
anybody who needs help.  I don't have any Traveller stuff except the
new  stuff, but can help anybody who needs it.  I am hoping this list
well teach me how to generated systems plants and sectors that match
reality but more importantly the flavor of the game that Traveller
represents.

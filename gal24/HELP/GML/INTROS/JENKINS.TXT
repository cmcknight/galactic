Subject: Bio & Intro [New]

Hi! This is my intro/bio for the List.

Name: James H. Jenkins
Email: s001jhj@alpha.wright.edu
WWW [under construction]: http://www.tightbeam.com/taugames

What I'm doing now:

a) I'm working (with excellent assistance from Jim V.) on making
modifications/ changes to Galactic to enable the user to input different
sector/subsector sizes, so that the program is also usable as a generic
sfrpg utility for sector/quadrant generation, with an alternate world
building formula. (So that sectors can be 5 X 5, with subsectors of 10 X
10, or 20 X 20, or whatever [within limits of course, depending on
screen sizes.])

This will probably end up as a seperate program, that I'd like to have
distributed to public domain, at the Galactic Website, or on my website
space at Tightbeam.com

My future plans:

b) A new sector for Classic Traveller, preferably rimward of the
Solomani Rim. Please send approval/ideas/suggestions on this. (Do I need
_APPROVAL_, or do I just _DO THE THING_, then submit?)

c) A scenario design for Classic Traveller.  I have some ideas cooking,
but nothing solid, yet.
 
d) In the future [this summer], I'd like to work on some type of add-on
module for Galactic to handle trade, figuring trade routes, based on
Merchant Prince, or Classic Trade System, that will let the user buy
goods, and then calculate the best market world within a certain radius.
(If this has been done already, I'd like to know.)

Background Info/Bio:

Age: 31

Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  Bought The Three Books in 77, after
seeing Star Wars, and immediately started playing/reffing after that.
Didn't discover T$R until about three years later.  As a teen, played
most anything on the market by both "Hardcore" Wargame Companies, SPI,
AH, etc. and RPG companies.

Attended A Programming Tech school, but decided after 8 months that I
was bored.

Joined U.S. Navy in 1984, worked on Anti-submarine weapons systems for 9
years, ran city-wide Battletech tournaments in San Diego, Ca. during
that time, plus a Traveller campaign set in Classic Sol Rim for 6 real
years of that time. Left the Navy in '92, during force draw-down.

Went back to school to get a degree in Physics, learned a lot, then got
tired of 8-10 hours of Differential Equations every night.  

Currently pursuing BA in Asian Religions. 

Last year, started my own roleplaying game company, am working to get my
first sfrpg published.  

Own about 90% of printed Traveller material, plus a whole bunch of other
rpg/wargames.

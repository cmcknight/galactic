Subject: Intro

> 1.  Information on which sectors and/or worlds you are developing.

I'm developing a completely different background than that of the
Official Traveller universe. I've kept the concept of "The Imperium" in
this universe but it is a different one.

> 2.  Requests for background data that would help your project.
> 3.  Suggestions regarding the general development of Galactic.

Printing functions would be most excellent!

> 3.  The area(s) of Galactic which you are interested in developing

My own Universe! I probably never would have attempted this without
GALACTIC!

> 4.  As much background information about yourself as you care to share

Well, let me see... I've been involved with RPGs since the very first
incarnation of D&D and played CT for a long time. I'm currently using MT
rules as all my CT stuff was stolen years ago.

I usually spend a dispraportionate amount of time working on games than I
do playing them.

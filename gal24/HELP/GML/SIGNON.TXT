
Dakin Burdick <burdickd@indiana.edu> has recently got the "Galactic
Mailing List" up and running.

He states the goals of the list as follows:

1.  Coordinate the creation of sector and world data.  The chief aim
    here is to avoid duplication or competition over development plans.
    If two people want to develop the same sector, then the first one to
    claim it takes precedence but may recruit the second to work on it.
    Once a sector is complete and added to the database of course, anyone
    can develop a world or adventure in it, which others must then follow
    in their own work.  These guidelines should increase the speed with
    which we not only develop the Classic sectors (my main interest), but
    also all the other alternate Traveller universes.

2.  Making the various designers aware of the various resources and talents
    of the others.  

To subscribe to the Galactic mailing list, send email to:

    majordomo@indiana.edu

Leave the subject line blank and type in the body of the text:

    subscribe burdickd_galactic

Majordomo will send you some info about the list along with its address.
If you wish to unsubscribe later, send to the majordomo@indiana.edu
address and type:

    unsubscribe burdickd_galactic

By the way, don't include a .SIG file with your message, as this will
mess up a majordomo mailer.

Dakin wants people to introduce themselves in their first message:

   "Tell us your name, email address, the area of galactic that
    you are working on or are interested in, and as much background
    about yourself as you would like to give us."

Anyway, I hope this info comes in handy... seeya on the list perhaps...

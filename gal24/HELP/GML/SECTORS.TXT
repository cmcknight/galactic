
I figured, just for the sake of organization, that we'd better figure
out what sectors are out there and who's working on them. Here is a list
of sectors that are either available as DGP raw sector data or are being
created whole by various people on the list. If I've screwed up anywhere
and need to amend this list, please let me know.

If you're interested in doing sector development from raw DGP data,
keep in mind that you can get the raw sector files from:

   http://deceased.hb.north.de/hosts/bakunin/traveller
   ftp://elendor.sbs.nau.edu/pub/rpg/traveller/sectors

Or I can email them to you. There are two version to be aware of,
DPG-original and DGP-updated. I'm not too clear on the difference,
but I've got both sets. I've been using DGP-updated for the
sectors which I included with Galactic, and I think that's the
version that bakunin has (since I emailed them to him so he
could put them online).

You may also want to check out the contents of the section2
directory which was included with this software package.
Section2.exe will help you disect the raw DGP sectors into
galactic-format subsectors. Keep in mind, however, that all the
worlds in the DGP sector file you are processing need to be
named in order for the program to work properly. Please write
me if you have any questions about it.

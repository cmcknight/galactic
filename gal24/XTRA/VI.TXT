    ----------------------------------

    Basic idea: vi is a text editor, which, most likely, you won't
       ever need to use. However, if for some strange reason you do
       want to learn to use vi, here are some very brief notes on a
       few commands you can use with this version of the program.

    To get into vi.
    vi <file>   (edits <file> where <file> is the name of your file.
                if <file> doesn't exist, then vi creates it)

    vi starts you in "escape mode".
    There are three modes. Escape, Command, and Insert.

    Escape Mode: Lets you move around the buffer or delete characters or lines
      and perform other minor functions. This is the mode you start in. This
      is the mode you should be in when you aren't actively entering text
      or performing a command-mode command.

    Insert Mode: Lets you enter text from the keyboard into the buffer.

    Command Mode: Lets you save your buffer to the filename you
      previously chose when you first went into vi. You can also bring
      other files into the buffer from this mode. Oh, and you go to this
      mode when you are ready to quit.

      ESC Mode commands
       j      go down        (you can also use
       k      go up          the arrow keys in
       l      go right       this DOS version
       h      go left        of the program)
       dd     delete line
       5dd    delete 5 lines
       x      delete character
       5x     delete 5 characters
       J      kill <carriage return> at end of line
       i      go into insert mode at cursor
       a      go into insert mode after cursor
       :      go into command mode
       ^g     shows line number
       G      goto bottom
       1G     goto top
       .      repeat last command

      Insert Mode commands
       <esc>  the <Esc> key takes you back to escape mode
              any other keys you type enters characters into the buffer
              remember to hit <enter> at the end of each line!

      Command Mode commands
      q    quit if there are no changes to file
      q!   quit w/o changing file
      w    writes file w/o quitting
      w!   damnit, i really want to save the file, and don't argue with me
      wq   write & quit (i.e. save the file and then quit, this is the
                       command you should generally use to get out of vi)
      r <file2>         read the contents of "file2" into the buffer
                        (when i say buffer, i mean editing-space)
      /<string>         Searches file for occurance of <string>
      /                 Searches file for occurance of last specified <string>
      (when in command mode, you have to hit <enter> to execute your command)
      (after the command is executed, you immediately go back to escape mode)

That should do it... if you want more info, consult your local UNIX guru.

These are the original world names files in a sorted format. If
you run out of names in any of the data files in the data\names
directory, say because you generated about a bazillion practice
sectors before you figured out what you really wanted to do, you
can copy the corresponding names file up to the data\names
directory, give it a .dat extension, scramble it using
mixname1.bat, and then begin using it as were it a brand new data
file. Send questions to either myself or Chuck, or read
data\names\readme.txt for more information.

                              MSORT and SSORT
                         Changes since version 1.0

1.12 December 26, 1994 MDK
    Command Line:  The output file is not cleared until the program is ready
                   to begin output. This helps avoid accidental removal of
                   the input file.

1.11 December 20, 1994  MDK
    Bug fixed:     One of the speed improvements had a bug for large files.
    Documentation: The file_id.diz was too wide for some BBS.

1.1 December 11, 1994   MDK
    Bug fixed:     MSORT would refuse to sort files under 512 bytes.
    Appearance:    Improved consistency of the spinner (user feedback of
                   work in progress).
    Speed:         a)   Improved handling of files with many repeated lines,
                        when the "Unique: option (-u) is set. The duplicate
                        lines are discarded as soon as possible.
                   b)   Minor fix to the algorithm for finding the end of
                        blocks to sort.
    Documentation: a)   Notice added that "Ignore short words" option (-t)
                        substantially slows sorting.
                   b)   Clarified the FILE_ID.DIZ and added notice that the
                        programs are "Well behaved" for multitasking.
                   c)   Added discussion of speeding up processing to
                        MSORT.DOC.

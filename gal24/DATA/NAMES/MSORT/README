To install MSORT, just copy the files into a directory in your DOS path. No
other installation is needed (assuming you have already uncompressed the
file, or you would not see this information).

For simple sorting, just type:
   MSORT InputFile SortedFile
where IinputFile is the file to sort, and SortedFile is the file to contain
the results.

There are many options available to control the sorting. There is also a
faster version SSORT included, but it can only sort files that can fit in
memory.

Read MSORT.DOC for more information about how to use this program.

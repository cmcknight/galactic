
If you are using pkunzip to unzip this software package, and didn't
specify the -d option, then it probably won't work right. You'd be best
off just moving the zipfile to an empty directory and typing:

   pkunzip -d gal24.zip

If you did this already, or used some other unzip utility, then you can
run the program by simply typing "gal" in the directory in which it was
unzipped.

See convert\readme.txt for information on converting your gal23 sectors
to gal24 format. Subscribe to the Galactic Mailing List (email the command
"subscribe burdickd_galactic" to majordomo@indiana.edu) for announcements
on future updates as well as to claim a sector of your own.

If you have any questions which were not covered in the program's help

program, _please_ email me.

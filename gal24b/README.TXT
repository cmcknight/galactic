
Possible Virus - Please Read:

The version of gal.exe included in gal24b.zip is a slightly
updated version of the main galactic program that was distributed
with gal24.zip. If you are using Galactic 2.4, you are advised
to delete xtra\rm.exe and copy this new version of gal.exe over
the 2.4 version that you are currently using. This is simply a
safety precaution. The reason for it is to eliminate the need
for xtra\rm.exe which was reported by someone trying to download
Galactic as having a virus named convbat.vxe in the xtra\rm.exe
file. This virus was purportedly detected by an antivirus software
called Innoculan NT. I am personally doubtful about the validity
of this report, as both Norton Antivirus 2.0 and McAfee AV with
virus definitions current as of Nov-16-1998 (Galactic v2.4 was
released Aug-1998) have failed to detected this supposed virus.
Nonetheless, since there is a potential risk, I felt it prudent
to act immediately to circumvent it.

Be advised that the only time that xtra\rm.exe was ever executed
by Galactic was when the user was deleting entire galaxies or
sectors via the use of the <delete> key from the galaxy list or
galaxy map. If you never did this, then you never ran xtra\rm.exe,
and so it's impossible for any potential virus to have been been
loosed on your system from xtra\rm.exe. This new version of
gal.exe does not call xtra\rm.exe, but instead calls the deltree
msdos command to delete galaxy or sector directories. Hence,
the program should still function exactly as it did before without
the necessity of xtra\rm.exe. Nonetheless, you should delete
xtra\rm.exe from your system anyway, just to be extra-safe.

On the Horizon:

I'm currently working on an rpg magazine index program, and to this
end, I'm entering the contents of numerous old rpg magazines into
a humongous text database. If you have old rpg magazines that you'd
like to get rid of and maybe make a little cash in the process,
please let me know. I can email you my wishlist complete with
title and issue numbers. I'm generally willing to pay up to cover
price on old magazines, so you can basically get out whatever you
put in.

As for Galactic, I'd like to put out version 2.5 sometime within
the next few months. Please get me your sectors and subprograms,
if you are working on any new ones. Many thanks for all the
support.
